'''Joseph Conrad''' (3 December 1857 – 3 August 1924) (real name: ''Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski'') was a  Poland|Polish writer. Conrad did not learn to speak English well until he was in his twenties and always had a Polish accent.

Conrad's prose style is considered as one of the best of all English novelists. He also is seen as important for paving the way to modernist literature. His narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced many modern writers and inspired such films as ''Apocalypse Now'' (after Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness'').

Conrad lived in the time of the British Empire and worked in the Merchant Navy.
