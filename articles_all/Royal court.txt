A '''royal court''' or '''noble court''' is the household of a royal family—including its advisors and attendents. The building is often called a palace, but the "royal court" means not just the buildings but all the royal household (all the people who live and work there). Someone who has a wikt:rank|rank in a royal court is called a '''Official|court official''' or '''courtier'''. A royal court can also include the wife|wives and concubines of the ruler.

It is called a court because in early times the palace would have a courtyard|court (an enclosed space) at the front.

In history there were great rulers who held important courts, e.g. Charlemagne.

A famous example is Hampton Court on the river Thames in London where Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII had his court.  Today the Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen holds court at Buckingham Palace.
