Naming history
The arena was named the '''Ford Center''' from 2002 to 2010. The name did not come directly from the Ford Motor Company; it instead came from a contract with Oklahoma Ford Dealers, a group that represents marketing efforts of the state's Ford dealers.

A new naming rights contract was signed with Chesapeake Energy in 2011, leading to the renaming as '''Chesapeake Energy Arena'''.
