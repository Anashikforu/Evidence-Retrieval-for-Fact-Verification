'''Haute couture''' (pronounced 'OHT koo-TOOR') is a French term for high fashion. It refers to the creation of exclusive custom-fitted clothing. The term refers to: 
 the fashion houses or fashion designers that create exclusive and often trend-setting fashions.
 the fashions created by them.

''Haute couture'' is made to order for a specific customer. It is usually made from high-quality, expensive fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finish by the most experienced and capable seamstresses, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. ''Couture'' is a common abbreviation of ''haute couture''.

In France, ''haute couture'' is ''une appellation juridiquement protégée'' (a legally protected name). It may only be used by firms which meet certain well-defined standards. However, the term is also used to describe all high-fashion custom-fitted clothing in other 'fashion capitals' such as Milan, London, New York, Tokyo and Madrid.

Have a workshop (''atelier'')Working process of garment Each season (that's twice a year), present a collection to the Paris press, with at least thirty-five runs/exits with outfits for both daytime wear and evening wear.

Membership is seldom given. Outside the ''Chambre syndicale'' are many successful fashion houses which deal in ''prêt-à-porter'' (the French term for ready-to-wear fashion). They have their own ''Chambre syndicale du prêt-à-porter''.
