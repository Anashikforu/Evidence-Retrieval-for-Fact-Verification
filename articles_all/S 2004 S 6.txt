'''''' is the designation of a dusty object seen orbiting Saturn (planet)|Saturn very close to the F ring. It is not clear whether it is only a clump of dust, or if there is a solid small moon at its core.

It was first seen by scientists in pictures taken by the Cassini-Huygens probe on October 28, 2004, and announced on 8 November that year.
 has been seen both inside and outside the main F ring, and its orbit must cross the ring. Careful calculations show that the object periodically plows through the ring material, coming within 1.5&nbsp;km of the densest core e.g. on 9 April, 2005. It has been suggested that a spiral structure in the thinnest material around the F ring may have been a result of this.

The dusty halo seen in pictures is big, being around 2000&nbsp;km in lengthwise extent. The solid object, if any, would be no bigger than 3âˆ’5&nbsp;km in diameter based on brightness.
