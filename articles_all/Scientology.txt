'''Scientology''' is a movement based on a system of beliefs. These beliefs are based on written words by author L. Ron Hubbard.  A few other people have added, but almost all of it is his.  He started it in 1954. Hubbard contributed until his death in 1986.  

Different people understand the words Hubbard wrote differently.  In some countries, there are Churches of Scientology. Some people are suspicious of the Church. They feel that it is a cult, and a business to make money. Scientology has been controversial since it began.Hugh B. Urban (2006): ''Fair Game: Secrecy, Security, and the Church of Scientology in Cold War America''. In: ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' 74 (2): 356â€“389, S. 356f.

Scientology teaches that people are Immortality|immortal spirits who have forgotten their true nature. Scientologists say that, through a system called ''auditing'', they help people remember their true nature by re-experiencing painful events in their past and understanding them better. 

There are many organizations that are linked to Scientology. For example, some help people stop using harmful drugs or to get back into society after they served a prison term. 

Scientology says that psychiatry is bad, and should   not be allowed to exist.
Number of followers
The Church of Scientology says that 13-15 million people are a part of the Church.Virginia Linn: ''Scientology comes to town''. In: ''The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', 24. Juli 2005. 
 The Church of Scientology 
The '''Church of Scientology''' was started by the American writer and  philosopher L. Ron Hubbard in the year 1954.  It is not as well known as Christianity or Islam, but it is newer. Scientologists believe their movement is growing. They claim it has thousands of churches, some of which are very small. The largest is in Clearwater, Florida.

= Basic beliefs of Scientologists =
 The word "Scientology" means "the study of knowledge."
 Man is made of a body, a mind, and a spirit. The spirit is the person himself. He uses his mind and body.
 The purpose of life is to survive.
 Harmful drugs should not be taken.
 Kinship|Affinity, reality, and communication help us get along with others.
 The better you Self-esteem|feel about yourself and life, the Freedom|freer you are.  This scale of emotion is called the Tone Scale.
 Auditing helps people look at thoughts and understand them better.  This in turn helps them feel better.
Auditing is very painful.

= Aims of Scientology =
L. Ron Hubbard wrote about the goals of Scientology, saying:
:"A civilization without Madness|insanity, without Crime|criminals and without war, where the able can prosper and honest beings can have rights, and where man is free to rise to greater heights, are the aims of Scientology."

This means the goals of Scientology are to create a civilization where:
 There is no mental illness, crime, or war
 People can be successful
 "Honest" people have rights
In 1972, Hubbard told a group of Scientologists: "You are the people Earth|the planet obeys. You are the people who own the planet."

= Dianetics =
Scientologists say that the book Dianetics was the first self-help book ever written. It was written by L Ron Hubbard in the year 1950. Some key concepts in the book are:
 A person's mind remembers painful times.  This helps a person to do bad things, and even get sick.  Dianetics calls these kinds of memories "engrams".
 A person's mind also remembers everything else.
 Auditing is meant to help a person understand his engrams.  Its goal is to become clear of them.

= ARC triangle =
Another basic teaching of Scientology is that understanding comes from three things together:
# Affinity (being willing to be close to other people);
# Reality (an agreement on what is real); and
# Communication (the exchange of ideas). 
Hubbard called this the "ARC Triangle." Scientologists use this in their everyday lives.  It is based upon the idea that making one of these three things better makes the other two better.

= Tone scale =
The tone scale is a way to rate an emotion as bad, better, or good.  The scale goes from -40 ("Total Failure") to +40 ("Serenity of Being").  Positions on the tone scale started from the idea that one way of feeling is better than a worse way of feeling.  But Hubbard described many other things that go along with emotion, such as health, Sexual intercourse|mating behavior, survival potential, and ability to deal with truth. The tone scale is frequently used by Scientologists to understand people. According to Scientology, the lower the individual is on the tone scale, the more complex his problems are.
