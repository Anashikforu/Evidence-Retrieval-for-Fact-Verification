'''''Sinovenator''''' is a small troodontid dinosaur, about the size of a chicken. It is from the early Cretaceous Period (geology)|period, 128.2&nbsp;million years ago. Two fossils were  found in the older (lower) portion of the Yixian Formation in China. It was part of the Jehol biota.Zhou Z. 2006. Evolutionary radiation of the Jehol Biota: chronological and ecological perspectives. ''Geological Journal'', '''41''': 377â€“393.

The type specimen of ''Sinovenator changii'' was described in 2002.Xu ''et al'' 2002. A basal troodontid from the early Cretaceous of China. ''Nature'' '''415''':780-784. The specimen is a partial skull and disarticulated skeleton. A second specimen has connected bones, but lacks the skull. Both are in the collection of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, China. 

''Sinovenator'' was a basal troodontid. It shares trait (biology)|features with the most primitive dromaeosaurids and Avialae. This shows the common descent of these three members of the Paraves.
