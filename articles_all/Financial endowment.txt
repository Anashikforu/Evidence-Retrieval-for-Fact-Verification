A '''financial endowment''' is money given to something to be saved in an investment. This is done so that the money will make a bigger difference when it is saved up over time.

An endowment is a structure used by large Nonprofit organization|non-profit organizations – such as Hospital|hospitals, Museum|museums, and University|universities – to raise donation capital in order to fund its operations on an ongoing basis. The endowment structure enables such non-profit organizations to manage a set of financial assets through which investment returns can be generated. Investment returns that are generated from the financial assets are then used to fund the operations of the non-profit and further grow the endowment.
