'''Wenedyk''' (in English: Venedic) is a constructed language|made-up language. '''Jan van Steenbergen''', a linguistics|linguist and translator from the Netherlands, made it in 2002. The idea behind it is this: what would have happened if the Polish language had developed from Latin language|Latin instead of Old Slavic languages|Slavic? Wenedyk is a possible answer to that question. It is a Romance languages|Romance language, so almost all words are family of words in French language|French, Italian language|Italian, Romanian language|Romanian, and so on. But they look very different and much more like Polish. The rules for spelling and pronunciation are completely based on Polish. Other parts of the language, like grammar and sentence structure, are a mixture of Polish and Romance.

Together with other made-up languages like Brithenig (which does the same thing with Welsh language|Welsh), Wenedyk is part of the group of so-called "alternative languages", languages that could have existed if history had been different. With Brithenig, it is the best known example of this sort of languages. Wenedyk became known in Poland after it was written about on the Internet and in the monthly paper ''Wiedza i Życie'' ("Knowledge and Life").

Wenedyk is used in Ill Bethisad, a made-up world in which the Roman Empire was stronger than in real history. It is the most important language of the '''Republic of the Two Crowns''', a country similar to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but not broken up by Partitions of Poland|partitions like Poland was.

 Spelling and pronunciation 

Wenedyk uses the same letters as Polish does:

:'''A Ą B C Ć D E Ę F G H I J K L Ł M N Ń O Ó P R S Ś T U W Y Z Ź Ż'''

Also, there are seven sounds written by two letters:

:'''Ch Cz Dz Dź Dż Rz Sz'''

Wenedyk is pronounced just like Polish. Stress almost always falls on the second-last syllable. A preposition and a pronoun are treated as one word, so when the pronoun has only one syllable, the preposition is stressed.

 Grammar 

Wenedyk does not have article (grammar)|articles, words like "a" and "the". This is an important difference with the other Romance languages and also with made-up languages like Esperanto and Ido. The reason is that Polish and most other Slavic languages do not have those words, and even in Vulgar Latin they were not so strong yet.

Words in Wenedyk can have many forms. English words have only a few ('''cat, cat's, cats; work, working, works, worked'''), but in Wenedyk a lot of forms exist where English would have used other words, like prepositions or verb|modal verbs. In the case of nouns, pronouns and adjectives these forms are called "cases". Wenedyk has three cases:
 the ''direct case'': used for both the subject and the direct object of a sentence. In the sentence: '''''Miej poterz'' leże ''libier''''' "My father reads a book", ''Miej poterz'' "my father" and ''libier'' "a book" are both in the direct case.
 the ''genitive'': used when English uses ''''s''' or '''of''', for example: '''siedź ''potrze''''' "''my father's'' chair", '''rzejna ''Anglie''''' "the queen ''of England''".
 the ''dative'': used when English uses (or can use) '''to''', for example: '''Da ''mi'' ił libier''' "Give ''me'' that book", '''Da ''mi'' łu''' "Give it ''to me''".
Wenedyk also has a ''vocative'' (used for calling someone). Often it has the same form as the direct case, but not always: '''O potrze!''' "Oh father!"

There are three genders and four declensions (different ways of making forms). They are very much like the declensions in Latin:
 the ''first declension'' are all words on '''-a''', almost all of them are feminine;
 the ''second declension'' are mostly masculine and neuter words ending with a consonant. It is a mixture of the second and fourth declension in Latin;
 the ''third declension'' are mostly feminine words ending with a soft consonant;
 the ''fourth declension'' are words on '''-ej''', it matches the Latin fifth declension.

Here is a chart of the pronouns (words like '''I, you, we, they''', and so on) in Wenedyk:



Verbs have a lot of forms, too. Every pronoun has its own form:
:'''jemu''' – I love
:'''jemasz''' – you love
:'''jema''' – he/she loves
:'''jemamy''' – we love
:'''jemacie''' – you love
:'''jemą''' – they love

Most grammatical tense|tenses have special forms:
:'''jemar''' – to love
:'''jemu''' – I love, I am loving
:'''jemawa''' – I loved
:'''jemie''' – I have loved
:'''joru jemar''' – I will love, I will be loving
