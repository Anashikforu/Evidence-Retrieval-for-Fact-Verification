'''Artsakh''', officially the '''Republic of Artsakh''' (), is a ''de facto'' independence|independent republic in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of the South Caucasus. It is internationally recognised to be part of Azerbaijan.

It has been populated for a long time by Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis since the Middle Ages and by the Armenian people|Armenians since the Classical antiquity. In the 11th century the Seljuk Empire|Seljuk invasion swept over the Middle East, including Transcaucasia. Nomadic Turkic peoples|Turkic Oghuz Seljuk tribes, which also include the Azerbaijanis, who were brought with this invasion became dominant in Nagorno-Karabakh.

The area has been disputed by Armenia and Azerbaijan since 1918. After the Soviet Union established control over the area, in 1923 it formed the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) within the Azerbaijan SSR. In the final years of the Soviet Union, the region again became a source of dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, resulting in the Nagorno-Karabakh War from 1988–1994.

On 10 December 1991, a referendum was held in the NKAO and the neighbouring Shahumian region, which was boycotted by the region's Azerbaijani population. This resulted in a declaration of independence from Azerbaijan as the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The country is not recognized by any United Nations|UN member state, including Armenia. Representatives of the governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan have since been holding peace talks mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group.
