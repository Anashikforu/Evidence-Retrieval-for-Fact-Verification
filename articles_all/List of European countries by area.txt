This is a '''list of European countries''', by geographical area:

Notes: Some of these countries are also considered part of Asia. Their names are given in ''italics'' and only their European area is given. 

Not all states within the geographical region are part of the European Union, although member states are in the majority. Non-member states are marked with an asterisk (). This currently includes all of the Asian border states.

Some of the smaller countries, marked (†), are represented indirectly in the EU by larger EU members.
