'''Cosmology''' is the branch of astronomy that deals with the origin, structure, evolution and space-time relationships of the universe.

Modern cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang theory, which brings together observational astronomy and particle physics. 

Though the word ''cosmology'' is recent (first used in 1730 in Christian Wolff's ''Cosmologia Generalis''), the study of the universe has a long history.

History
Until recently, people thought that the universe was only the Milky Way galaxy. They thought this because they could only see the planets up to Saturn (planet)|Saturn and stars. With the invention of the telescope, we could see more of the universe. Even in the 20th century, people thought that the Milky Way was the entire universe. With the Hubble Space Telescope, people could see things far away.

Modern cosmology is considered to have started in 1915|1917 with the final paper of Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein's General relativity|theory of general relativity. This paper was known as "Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity"

The Big Bang model was then created by Belgium|Belgian priest, Georges Lema√Ætre in 1927. 

All of these discoveries have been further supported throughout the 20th century. Some more observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation were found by the Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE, These are known as Redshift survey|redshift surveys. Survey is this context refers to an astronomical survey. An astronomical survey is a place in Outer space|space. A redshift survey is a survey that looks for redshifts.

On 1 December 2014, at the ''Planck 2014'' meeting in Ferrara, Italy|Ferrara, Italy, astronomers reported that the universe is Age of the universe|13.8 billion years old and is composed of 4.9% regular matter, 26.6% dark matter and 68.5% dark energy.
