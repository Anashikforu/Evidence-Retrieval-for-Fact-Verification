'''Washington, D.C.''' (also known as simply '''Washington''' or '''D.C.''', and officially as the '''District of Columbia''') is the capital of the United States. It is a federal district. The President (United States)|President of the USA and many major national government offices are in the territory. This makes it the political center of the United States of America.

Washington was named after the first U.S. President George Washington. "D.C." stands for "District of Columbia". At first, it was made up of a piece from Virginia south of the Potomac River and a piece from Maryland north of the Potomac River. In 1847, Virginia's piece was returned to it, and is now Arlington, Virginia|Arlington County and part of the city of Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria. Since 1847, all of the District of Columbia is on the north side of the Potomac River. The District of Columbia used to have other small towns which used "D.C.".

All of the major Political parties in the United States|political parties are based here. It is also the headquarters of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Organization of American States (OAS).

In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau|United States Census Bureau said that 689,545 people lived within the District of Columbia.

 History 
When English people first came to the area, there was a Native American village on the spot called ''Nakochtank''. This name survives in the name of the Anacostia River. This river was known for the healing properties of its pure water and it is recorded that the Emperor Powhatan, who lived in what is now Richmond, Virginia, made the trip all the way to Nakochtank once for this reason.

The 1789 United States Constitution said that a capital city would be created in a district, but did not say where it should be. James Madison and others thought it should be far away from other states and cities. This way, it would be independent and not controlled by any state. In 1790, a wikt:compromise|compromise was reached and capital was placed between Virginia and Maryland. It was a square, ten miles (16&nbsp;km) long on each side, and split by the Potomac River, which separated the two states. Half of the district was in Maryland and the other half was in Virginia, and the two states gave this land to the government. In 1791, it was named ''Washington, the District of Columbia'' to honor George Washington. ''Columbia'' was another name for North America.

 City design 

Washington, D.C. was planned before it was built. Pierre L'Enfant drew a plan for the city that said where all the streets, parks, and important buildings would be.

The National Mall is an example of this.

The license plates on the cars in Washington, D.C. say, "Taxation Without Representation."
