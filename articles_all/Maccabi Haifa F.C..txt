History
=First seventy years of obscurity=
Maccabi Haifa Football Club was established in 1913 in the port city of Haifa. It was a small, struggling club that spent most of its time between the Liga Leumit and the lower leagues. 

The club was overshadowed by their city rivals Hapoel Haifa F.C.|Hapoel Haifa, who were then the darling club of the city of Haifa and especially of then mayor Abba Hushi. But even in its first years the club adapted a very adventurous and offensive style of play based on technique and short passes. In 1942, the club reached the Israel State Cup final, but was humiliated 12-1 by Beitar Tel Aviv F.C.|Beitar Tel Aviv in the final, which is the club's worst defeat ever. In 1962, the club won its only honour until the 80s, when the team defeated Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv 5-2 in the Israel State Cup|State Cup final. In 1963 they reached the final again, but failed to defend their title losing to arch-rivals Hapoel Haifa F.C.|Hapoel Haifa 1-0.
