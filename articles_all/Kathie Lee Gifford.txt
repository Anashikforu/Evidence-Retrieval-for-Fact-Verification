=1996 sweatshop controversy=
In 1996 the National Labor Committee, a human rights group, reported that sweatshop labor was being used to make clothes for the Kathie Lee line, sold at Walmart.
Labor activist, Charles Kernaghan, spoke on media. He accused Gifford of being responsible for the sweatshop management activity. Gifford addressed Kernaghan's allegations on the air during ''Live'', explaining that she was not involved with hands-on project management in factories. 

Gifford later contacted Federal authorities to investigate the issue and worked with U.S. Federal legislative and executive branch agencies to support and enact laws to protect children against sweat shop conditions. She met with President Bill Clinton at the White House in order to support of the government's initiatives to counter international sweatshop abuses.

''Today''
On March 31, 2008, NBC announced that Gifford was to join its morning show, ''Today'', as co-host of the fourth hour, alongside Hoda Kotb. This marked her return to morning television; in many markets, she now airs directly after her old show, now called ''Live! with Kelly and Michael''. Because the fourth hour of ''Today'' airs live at 10:00am ET, and ''Live! with Kelly and Michael'' airs live at 9:00am ET, Gifford's hour does not compete directly with her former show in most markets. Kotb and Gifford replaced Ann Curry and Natalie Morales. 

She started hosting ''Today'' on April 7, 2008 with Hoda Kotb.
