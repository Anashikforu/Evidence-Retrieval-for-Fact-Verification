Image:317305 at Cambridge.jpg|thumb|right|Class 317/1, no. 317305 at Cambridge on 23rd May 2003. This unit was one of several loaned by West Anglia Great Northern|WAGN to LTS Rail from 1996-1999, which involved the red stripe of the Network SouthEast|NSE livery being repainted green. This unit is now numbered 317505 and operated by Greater Anglia.
The '''British Rail Class 317''' electric multiple units were built by BREL at York Works in two batches, from 1981-82 and 1985-87.  They were the first of several classes of British Rail EMU to be based on the all-steel British Rail Mark 3|Mark 3 bodyshell, departing from the British Rail Class 445|"PEP"-aluminium design which had spawned the earlier British Rail Class 313|Class 313 to British Rail Class 315|Class 315. The Mark 3 bodyshell was also the basis of British Rail Class 318|Class 318, British Rail Class 455|Class 455, and the diesel "sprinters" pioneered by the British Rail Class 150|Class 150.
