'''Octopoda''' is one of the largest order (biology)|orders which contain the common octopus and some other types.William Elford Leach, 1818. 
Octopods are put into two suborders. One, the Incirrina, is composed of the well-known ''Octopus'' of rocky shores and coral reefs and its relatives. The other suborder, the Cirrina, contains octopods whose tentacles are linked by an umbrella-like mantle, so their activity is rather different from the common octopus.
