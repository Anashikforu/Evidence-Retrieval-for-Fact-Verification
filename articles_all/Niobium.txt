'''Niobium''' is a chemical element. It is sometimes named '''columbium'''. It has the chemical symbol '''Nb'''. It has the atomic number 41. It is a wikt:rare|rare metal. Niobium is soft and grey. It is wikt:ductile|ductile. In chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the transition metals. Niobium was discovered in a variety of a mineral called columbite (now called niobite). Niobite is an ore of niobium.G.V. Samsonov {ed) 1968. Mechanical properties of the elements. In ''Handbook of the physicochemical properties of the elements''. New York, USA: IFI-Plenum.

Niobium is considered a ''technology-critical element''. It is used in alloys, such as to make special steels and strong Welding|welded joints. Less than 0.1% of Niobium significantly improves the strength of steel.Patel, Zh. & Khul'ka K. 2001. ''Niobium for steelmaking''. ''Metallurgist''. '''45''' (11–12): 477–480. It is in the superconduction|superconducting alloys used in MRI scanners, which are one of the most important medical inventions of the modern age.
