A '''habitat''' is the area in which an organism lives. It is a summary term for all the resources, physical and living which are present in an area.

 Animal habitats 
Most animals live in one type of environment because they are best suited to it. We say they are 'adaptation|adapted to this environment'. For example, animals such as frogs, newts, and ducks have webbed feet to help them swim in the water. There are many different types of habitats and many kinds of adaptations to each habitat.

If the habitat changes, it may no longer be suitable for the animals and plants that live there. Climate change is making some habitats Global warming|warmer, and so many animal species are moving to cooler areas. This is threatening the survival of forest animals such as the koala.

 Plant habitats 
Just as animals adapt to the places they live, so do plants. Plants are adapted to a wide variety of habitats. As a result, each plant has certain characteristics. Some are adapted to living on land while others live in water. Plants that grow on land usually have stiff stems to hold them upright, while water plants tend to have less rigid stems because the water supports them.

Plants that live in dry climates like the desert have few or no leaves.  Many, such as cacti, store water when rain occurs.  Their adaptations save water.  Plants that grow in shaded areas have large leaves to capture as much sunlight as possible, or they climb towards the light.
