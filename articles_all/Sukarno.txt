'''Sukarno''' (6 June 1901 â€“ 21 June 1970) was the first President of Indonesia. He helped the country win its independence from Netherlands|the Netherlands. He was President from 1945 to 1967, presiding with mixed success over the country's rough switch to independence. Sukarno was forced to resign by one of his generals, Suharto. Suharto formally became President in March 1967.

The spelling "Sukarno" has been official in Indonesia since 1947. It is still common to see the older spelling '''Soekarno''', mainly because he signed his name with the old spelling. Official Indonesian presidential decrees from 1947-1968, however, printed his name using the 1947 spelling.

Indonesians also remember him as '''''Bung'' Karno''' or '''''Pak'' Karno'''.''Bung'' is an Indonesian language|Indonesian term of endearment similar to 'older brother', ''Pak'' is more formal, like 'sir' or 'father'. Like many Java (island)|Javanese people, he had only one name; in religious contexts, he was occasionally referred to as 'Achmad Sukarno'.
