'''Serial communication''' is a term used to describe systems used for telecommunications, as well as certain technology|technologies used for computing. When using serial communication, only one bit is transferred at a time, for example over a communication channel or computer bus.

Many computer networks, as well as many lines where Information|data is transferred over a long distance use serial communication.

Examples for serial communication

RS-232, a low-speed serial port used on some PCs; RS-423 and RS-485 are variations of this
Universal Serial Bus|USB is a standard to connect peripherals to computers
