He was part of the Manhattan Project team that made the atomic bomb. Feynman won the Nobel Prize in Physics 1965. He was one of the first people to study quantum physics. Feynman added significantly to a wikt:branch|branch of science called quantum electrodynamics and invented the Feynman diagram. He died of liposarcoma in Los Angeles, California.

His sister Joan Feynman (born 1927) is a retired Astrophysics|astrophysicist.
