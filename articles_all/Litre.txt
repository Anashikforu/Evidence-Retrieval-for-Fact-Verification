In 1795 the kilogram was defined to be exactly one litre of water at 4&nbsp;°C. In 1799 the kilogram was redefined. The new definition said that the kilogram was the mass of the ''kilogram|kilogram des archives''. In 1901 scientists measured the volume of one litre of water at 4&nbsp;°C very carefully.Water has its maximum density at 4&nbsp;°C.  They found that it occupied about &nbsp;dm3. The BIPM redefined the litre as being ''exactly'' the volume of one kilogram of water at 4&nbsp;°C.

In 1960 the International System of Units|SI was introduced.  The BIPM changed the definition of the litre back to "one dm3". The litre is not part of SI. The BIPM defined the litreThe hectare|are and the tonne were also defined as  "Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI". as a "Non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI". This was because it is used in many  countries. The BIPM said that the litre should not be used for very accurate work.

According to SI rules, the symbol for the litre should be "l". This is because the litre was not named after somebody whose name was "Litre".For example, the symbol for watts is "W" because watts were named after James Watt. However the symbol "l" and the number "1" are easily confused. In 1979 the BIPM made an exception for the symbol for the litre. They said that people could use either "L" or "l" as its symbol.

In Europe, milk is sold in one litre cartons. One litre bottle is also a popular package for soft drinks. Most alcoholic drinks are sold as 1/3 litre (0.33 l), ½ litre (0.5 l) or 3/4 litre (0.75 l) bottles.
