'''Magnoliids''' (or '''Magnoliidae''' or '''Magnolianae''') are a group of flowering plants. They are descendants of the earliest flowering plants: they keep some features which look like those of conifers.

The group include magnolias, nutmeg, bay laurel, cinnamon, avocado, black pepper, tulip tree and many others.  They  have three-part flowers, pollen with one pore, and usually branching-veined leaves.

The '''magnoliids''' has today about 9,000 species of flowering plants. The group has many food crops (such as avocados) and many with narcotic|psychotropic effects. The famous Polynesian drink kava is prepared from a magnoliad, and nutmeg fruits are a source of the hallucinogen myristicin. 

Psychotropic effects are usually a defence against herbivory.
