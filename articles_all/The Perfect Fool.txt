'''''The Perfect Fool''''' is an opera in one act with music written by the English composer Gustav Holst. Holst wrote the work over the time period from 1918 to 1922.  The opera was first played at the Covent Garden Theatre, London on May 14, 1923. At the beginning, Holst had asked Clifford Bax to write the libretto, but Bax did not want to do so.

In the musical score, Holst made fun of the musical works of Verdi, Richard Wagner|Wagner's work ''Parsifal''
