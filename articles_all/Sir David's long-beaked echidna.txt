All of them are found in New Guinea. It is named after Sir David Attenborough. It lives in the Cyclops mountains in Western New Guinea|Papua province of Indonesia near the cities of Sentani, Jayapura. 

The species was described from a single damaged animal, which was collected in the Dutch colonial era (c. 1961). It has not been collected since that time. 

It is the smallest member of the genus. It is closer in size to the short-beaked echidna than other members of the genus. It has five claws on its fore and hind feet. It has dense short fur.
