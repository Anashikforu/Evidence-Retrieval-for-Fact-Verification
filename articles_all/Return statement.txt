A '''return statement''' is the information that part of a software|computer program gives to another part. In object-oriented programming, the term '''return''' is used by methods to perform an output. Much like when a button is pressed on a vending machine, then the item you bought comes out (the vending machine '''returns''' your item), and so when an Object (computer science)|object performs a Object (computer science)|method, something is '''returned'''. Specifically what is returned depends on an special identifier called a '''return type'''.

 Return Type 

A '''return type''' is a required part of any method, because it tells the computer what the user wants to be returned to whatever called (used) the method. If an integer was expected, then typically the method would have a return type of int, as int is the common name for an integer in computer science. There are several return types that can be found to most programming languages.

= Integer =

Means a method returns an integer, a whole number.

= Double =

Means a method returns a double value. This is the default method of using numbers with decimal points.
