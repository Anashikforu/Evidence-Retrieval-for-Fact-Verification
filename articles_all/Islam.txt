All of its teachings and beliefs are written out in the Quran (also spelled Qur'an or Koran), the holy scripture of Islam. Believers of Islam are called '''Muslims. Islam''' means submission to the '''will of God.''' They believe that the Quran was spoken to Muhammad|Muhammad ﷺ by the angel Gabriel. The Quran is regarded as the word of God (or Allah). The muslims view Muhammad ﷺ as a prophet and messenger of God. Other beliefs and rules about what Muslims should do come from Hadith|reports of what Muhammad ﷺ taught '''(Hadith)'''.Kamali, Mohammad Hashim.

Linguistically, Islam is defined as surrender to the command of God without objection, without submission, rebellion, and stubbornness. As for its idiomatic meaning, it is the religion that was brought by “Muhammad ﷺ bin Abdullah,” sent by Almighty God, and which Muslims believe is the law with which God sealed the heavenly messages. In a hadith on the authority of Abu Hurairah that the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ defined Islam: “By worshiping God and not associating anything with Him, performing the prayer, paying the obligatory zakat, fasting Ramadan and performing the pilgrimage to the house of God.”  

Muslim saints|Muslims believe that there were many other prophets before Muhammad ﷺ since dawn of humanity, beginning with the Prophet Adam and Eve|Adam and including the Prophet Noah (Nuh), the Prophet Ibrahim|Abraham (Ibrahim), the Prophet Moses (Musa), and the Prophet Jesus (Isa). They believe that all these prophets were given messages by God of the oneness of God to their communities at different times in history of mankind, but Satan (referred to as 'Shaytan' in Arabic) made the past communities deviate from the message of oneness and other social codes. Muslims believe that the content of the Quran (written in Arabic) is protected by Allah as mentioned in the Quran and is the final message of God for all of mankind until the day of judgment.

Most Muslims belong to one of two groups.  The most common is Sunni Islam (75–90% of all Muslims are Sunni Muslims). The second is Shia Islam (10–20% of all Muslims are Shias – also called Shiites). But there are many more groups like the Alevis in Turkey.

 revealed to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ through Gabriel. They believe that he is the final messenger of all messengers that are sent before him. The Prophets are human beings and children of Adam, whom God chose to be his messengers. Muslims believe that the prophets are not gods, but merely human beings with some miracles to prove their prophethood. They are the ones who receive divine revelation.

The Quran mentions the names of many prophets, including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and others. According to the Qur’an, all of the prophets were Muslims who preached Islam, but with different laws. Islam is defined in the Qur’an as “the instinct of God upon which people have broken in.” "Therefore set your face to the religion purely, the upright creation upon which He originated people. There is no change in the creation of Allah. This is the valuable religion, although most people do not know} (The Romans -Ar-Rum Surah, versus 30) Muslims also believe that Hanifism is the basis of Abraham's religion. And they see that the difference between the Abrahamic religions is in the Sharia (Law) only and not in the creed and that the Sharia of Islam abrogates what preceded it from the Sharia. this means that Islamic religion consists of Belief and Sharia.

As for belief, it is the set of principles that a Muslims|Muslim must believe in, and it is fixed and does not differ according to the different prophets. As for Sharia (Law), it is the name for practical rulings that differ according to the different messengers.

# '''Salaat (Also spelled as Salaah, if in the end of sentence)''': Muslims Prayer|pray five times per day, at special times of the day.  When they pray, they face Kaaba, a large cubic structure located at the Sacred|holy city of Mecca. ''Salat'' is ''namaz'' in Persian language|Persian, Turkish language|Turkish and Urdu language|Urdu. Shia Muslims can pray the afternoon and evening prayers right after each other.The Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims: A Short Introduction - Page 28, Jimmy R. Davis - 2007 
# '''Zakat''': Muslims who have money must give a percentage of the money which it's still with them for a year Zakat|1/40th of their money (''Charity (practice)|charity'' in English) to help people who do not have money or need help.
# '''Sawm (Also spelled as Siyam or Sum)''':  Fasting during Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic year.  Muslims do not eat or drink from Fajr till sunset for one Lunar calendar|lunar month. After Ramadan, there is a holiday called ''Eid al-Fitr'' (which means "festival of end-fast" in English). On Eid al-Fitr, Muslims usually go to the mosque in the morning after sunrise for a special Salaah.
# '''Hajj''' (Pilgrimage in English): During the month of Zulhejja, the 12th month of the Islamic Calendar is the pilgrimage season where many Muslims go to Mecca, the holiest city of Islam. However, if a Muslim is financially unable to perform the Hajj, it is not necessary for them to do so. Those who possess great financial capacity were the most obligated to perform the Hajj.

The Quran is the central point of reference and is a link which connects humanity with God.

The Qur'an contains many passages and chapters which covers the entire aspect of humanity, down to the most minute detail. From the creation and conception of human child to the details of the Earth and beyond.

The Qur'an has a total of 30 Juzuks. In each Juz, there are many Surahatun or verses, with 114 Surahatun which begins with Surah al-Fatehah (The Beginning) and ended with Surah an-Naas(Humanity).
