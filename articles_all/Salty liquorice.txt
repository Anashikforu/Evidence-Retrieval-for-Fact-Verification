'''Salty liquorice''', or '''Salmiak''', is a salt candy that is eaten in Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands.  The candy comes in different strengths; in the Netherlands, it comes as ''Zout'' (Salted), ''Dubbel zout'' (Double Salt or DZ) and ''Drievoudig zout'' (Triple salt, or 3Z).  The substance used to give salt liquorice its characteristic taste is not regular table salt, Sodium Chloride (Na2Cl), but Ammonium Chloride (NH4Cl). The Dutch name for this type of Liquorice, Salmiak, comes from the words "Sal Ammoniac", another name for Ammonium Chloride.
