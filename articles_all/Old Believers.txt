In the Russian Orthodox church history, the '''Old Believers''' (, read ''starovery'' or ''staroobryadtsy'') became separated after 1666-1667. They split from the  hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church as a protest against church reforms introduced by Patriarch Nikon. Old Believers continue Liturgy|liturgical practices which the Russian Orthodox Church followed before the reform. 
 
Russian-speakers refer to the schism itself as ''raskol'' ('''раскол'''). This word comes from a Russian word ''расколоться'', that means "to cleave apart").

For this reason, he changed a few rituals and texts in 1651. These changes were made to the Russian rituals to be closer to the Greek ones of Nikon's time. According to the Old Believers, Nikon did this without the support of the clergy. and without a council. When the changes were done, people who still practised the old rites were Persecution|persecuted.
