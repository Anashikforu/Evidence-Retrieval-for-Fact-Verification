British Rail's '''Class 370''' tilting trains, also referred to as '''APT-P''' (meaning '''A'''dvanced '''P'''assenger '''T'''rain '''P'''rototype), were the pre-production Advanced Passenger Train units. Unlike the earlier experimental gas-turbine '''British Rail APT-E|APT-E''' unit, these units were powered by 25kV AC overhead lines|overhead electrification and were used on the West Coast Main Line between Euston station|London Euston and Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central. The APT-P is the most powerful domestic train to have operated in Britain, the eight traction motors fitted to the two central Motor Cars giving a total output of 8,000 Horsepower|hp. This enabled the train to set the UK rail speed record of 162.2&nbsp;mph in December 1979, a record that stood for 23 years.
