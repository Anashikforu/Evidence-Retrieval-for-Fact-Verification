'''Druze''' (;; ''DurÅ«z'') is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion. Druze is related to Islam and Christianity but more based on philosophy. The religion was founded by Hamza ibn Ali, who preached that Al-Hakim, a ruler of Egypt, was a "Manifestation of God". The name Druze probably comes from Darazi, a preacher who was expelled from the Druze religion, because he preached that Al-Hakim was literally God.  

Its adherents, called Muwahiddun are an Arabic language|Arabic-speaking people of the Middle East. There are more than 500,000 Muwahiddun. Most of them live in Syria and Lebanon. Some have emigrated to the United States and Canada. Although sometimes many Muwahiddun consider themselves part of Shia Islam, in Israel they are considered part of a different ethnic and religious group within the Arabic-speaking minority.  

Muwahiddun in Lebanon had a major political influence and were the rulers of Lebanon before the 1860s. After the 1860s, they shared the ruling of Mount Lebanon with the Maronites and were later considered the 4th major religious sect after independence. They played a key role in fighting against the Lebanese Christian right during the early 1980s. Muwahiddun ended their fighting against the Lebanese Christian right in late 1990.  In 1990 and 1991, they gained representation in Lebanon's government in accordance with a 1989 peace agreement.
After DNA analysis of Shroud of Turin it is believed that Jesus shares 96% DNA with Druze.
