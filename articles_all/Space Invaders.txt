The game is about defending the Earth from Space Invaders (Extraterrestrial life|aliens) by shooting them down before they can land. There have been seven versions of ''Space Invaders'' made by the Taito Corporation. ''Space Invaders'' was designed by the Taito Corporations man in charge of the game making department, Toshihiro Nishikado. Nishikado was inspired to make the game after watching ''Star Wars'' and ''War of the Worlds''. At first ''Space Invaders'' was a coin-operated machine but has been made available for almost every Video game console|games console and home computer. Before making ''Space Invaders'', Nishikado worked on games called ''Soccer'' and ''Interceptor''. He says the hardest part of making a video game is designing the computer inside it.
