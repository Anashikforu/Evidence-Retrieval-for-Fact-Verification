A '''baseball park''', '''baseball stadium''', or '''ball park''' / '''ballpark''' is a stadium|place where baseball is played. It refers to the field of play, seating areas (if any) and any other things added to it. 

The flexible rules about baseball fields (aside from the rigid rules of sizes of basepaths and pitcher's mound) allow ballparks to have their own character and quirks. This happens at all levels of baseball, amateur and especiallyMajor League Baseball| professional. This makes each stadium interesting and unique. 

 Field 
The '''baseball field''' is a grassy field that is about  or more in diameter,
The infield is a square (usually called a "diamond"), with each side being  or more away from home plate) to form the foul lines. Most of what happens in a baseball game happens in the area of the field in between the foul lines and the outfield fence, which is called fair territory. All other areas of the field (except the foul lines) are called foul territory.
