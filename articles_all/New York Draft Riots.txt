The '''New York Draft Riots''' (July 13 â€“ 16, 1863; known at the time as '''Draft Week''') were Riot|violent disturbances in New York City. They happened when anger with President Lincoln and his laws was highest. At first it just wanted to show anger at the draft. But the protests became violent and "a virtual racial pogrom, with uncounted numbers of African-American people|blacks murdered on the streets". Major General John E. Wool said on July 16, "Martial law ought (should) to be proclaimed, but I have not a sufficient (enough) force to enforce it." The military stopped the mob using weapons. However, they had already destroyed many buildings, including homes and an orphanage for black children.
