An '''''escopetarra''''' is a guitar made from a rifle; it is used as a symbol of peace. The name is a  combination of the Spanish language|Spanish words ''escopeta'' (meaning shotgun/rifle) and ''guitarra'' (meaning guitar). 

''Escopetarras'' were invented in 2003 by a Colombian peace activist named Cesar Lopez|César López. At a gathering after the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing|El Nogal Club bombing in Bogotá, he noticed a soldier holding a gun like a guitar and got the idea for it.
López made five ''escopetarras'', four of which were given to Colombian musician Juanes, Argentine musician Fito Páez, the United Nations Development Program, and the city  government of Bogotá, while one was kept for himself. Juanes later sold his ''escopetarra'' for US$17,000 at a Beverly Hills fundraiser held to help victims of anti-personnel mines, 

In 2006, López got 12 more decommissioned AK-47s from Colombia's peace commissioner's office. After they are turned into guitars, he plans to give them to popular musicians such as Shakira, Carlos Santana, and Paul McCartney, as well as political figures such as the Dalai Lama. However, a member of the Dalai Lama's staff rejected López' offer, saying it is not appropriate to give a weapon as a gift; López has said he will try to explain his purpose more clearly.
