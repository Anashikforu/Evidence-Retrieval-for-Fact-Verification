He auditioned for ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' at the same time as he asked for the role of Simon Brown in ''Nanny McPhee'', but lost the role to Thomas Sangster. His voice got deeper when he was filming ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'', so his sister Soumaya had to voice some of his lines.

Recently, he starred in ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'', the third installment of ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' movie series. The filming began in July 2009, and finished in December of the same year. The movie was released on 10 December 2010 in Britain and the US.
