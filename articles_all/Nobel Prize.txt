.Nobel Prizes cannot be awarded posthumously (to people who are no longer living). People who receive a Nobel Prize are called "Nobel laureates".

Each prize winner gets a medal, a diploma and a sum of money.

 Prize categories and winners 
These are the committees and institutions who decide which people receive a Nobel Prize:
 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for the Nobel Prize in Physics and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel
 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
 The Karolinska Institutet for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
 The Swedish Academy Nobel Prize in Literature
 The Norwegian Nobel Committee, appointed by the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget), for Nobel Peace Prize

The ''Nobel Prize in Economics'' was not a part of Nobel's will. It was started in 1969 by Sveriges Riksbank, the Bank of Sweden. The bank donated money to the Nobel Foundation for the Economics Prize in 1968. The Economics Studies Prize is in the memory of Alfred Nobel. It is awarded each year with the other Nobel prizes.
