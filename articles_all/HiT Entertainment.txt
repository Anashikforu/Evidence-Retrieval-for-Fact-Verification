'''HiT Entertainment''' was a British-American entertainment company owned by Mattel and was originally established in 1982 as Henson International Television, the international distribution arm of The Jim Henson Company|Jim Henson Productions. They were known for owning and distributing shows such as ''Thomas and Friends|Thomas & Friends'', ''Barney & Friends'', ''Bob the Builder'', ''Fireman Sam'', ''Pingu'', and ''Angelina Ballerina''. They also provided distribution rights for several titles in the ''Jim Henson'' library that weren't owned by The Walt Disney Company|Disney or Sesame Workshop, and were responsible for the US distribution of ''The Wiggles'' videos from 2001 to 2007.

From mid 2001 to early 2002, HiT Entertainment|HiT distributed five of Big Idea's VeggieTales videos and one album as a result of acquiring the company's mass market distributor, Lyrick Studios.

Because Big Idea had not made a partnership with HiT Entertainment (primarily because HiT Entertainment|HiT was not usually interested in working with properties they did not own), Big Idea turned to Warner Home Video to serve as their new mass market distributor in 2002. HiT Entertainment|HiT responded to this by filing a lawsuit against them in federal court for "breach of contract."

Their lawsuit against Big Idea was one of the major causes of Big Idea's bankruptcy in 2003 shortly after the release of ''Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie''.

In 2009, when Entertainment Rights was facing bankruptcy, HiT Entertainment|HiT was one of three bidders to potentially purchase the company's library.

On February 1, 2012, HiT Entertainment was acquired by Mattel, and was eventually folded into their TV division, ''Mattel Creations'', on March 31, 2016.
