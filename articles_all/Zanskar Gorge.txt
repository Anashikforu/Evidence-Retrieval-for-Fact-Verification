The '''Zanskar Gorge''' is found in the Zanskar region of Jammu and Kashmir. Its walls are near vertical cliffs up to 600m high.  The Zanskar River (a tributary of the Indus River) is only 5m wide in places.  It provides an access route to the Zanskar Valley, but only in winter when the river is frozen.
