'''Ascomycota''' is a phylum of fungi (kingdom (biology)|kingdom Fungi). Members are commonly known as the '''sac fungi'''. They have a sac, the '''ascus''', which contains four to eight ascospores in the sexual stage.

The structure defines the group and distinguishes it from other fungi. The ascus is a tube-shaped sac, which contains the sexual spores produced by meiosis and which are called ''ascospores''.

It was used in genetics because it contains the results of crossing-over between chromosomes.
