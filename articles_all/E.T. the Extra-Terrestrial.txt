'''''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial''''' is a 1982 United States|American science fiction movie produced and directed by Steven Spielberg, and written by Melissa Mathison. It follows the eponymous Extraterrestrial life|alien, who is stranded on Earth. A boy and his family keep it hidden from the group of government agents, while bringing it home.

Filming took place from September to December 1981 on a budget of $10.5 million (equivalent to $25 million in 2019 dollars).

Released on June 11, 1982, by Universal Pictures, ''E.T.'' was an immediate blockbuster, surpassing ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars'' to become the highest-grossing movie of all timeâ€”a record it held for 11 years until ''Jurassic Park (movie)|Jurassic Park'', another Spielberg movie, surpassed it. ''E.T.'' was widely acclaimed by critics and is considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time. It was re-released in 1985, and again in 2002, to celebrate its 20th anniversary, with altered shots and additional scenes.

Having worked with Cary Guffey on ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'', Spielberg felt confident in working with a cast of mostly child actors.

The major voice work for E.T. was Pat Welsh (actress)|Pat Welsh, an elderly woman who lived in Marin County, California. Welsh smoked two packets of cigarettes a day, which gave her voice a quality that sound effects creator Ben Burtt liked. Burtt also recorded 16 other people and various animals to create E.T.'s "voice". These included Spielberg; Debra Winger; Burtt's sleeping wife, who had a cold; a burp from his University of Southern California|USC movie professor; and raccoons, sea otters, and horses."The Making of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"--from the "E.T. Signature Collection LaserDisc", MCA/Universal Home Video, 1996

Doctors working at the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center|USC Medical Center were recruited to play the doctors who try to save E.T. Spielberg felt that actors in the roles, performing lines of medical talking, would come across as unnatural.
