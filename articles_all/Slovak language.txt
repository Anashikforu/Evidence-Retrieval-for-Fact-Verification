'''Slovak''' is the language spoken in Slovakia, a country in Central Europe. It is a language from Slavic languages|Slavic language family. It is very similar to Czech language|Czech, and Czechs and Slovaks understand each other quite well when they speak their own language. Polish and Sorbian language|Sorbian are also quite similar. All of them belong to the western branch of Slavic languages. Slovak is spoken by more than 5 million people.

 Pronunciation 
Slovak is written using the Latin script|Latin alphabet, but some letters have special signs (called Diacritic|diacritics).

The letters č, š, ž and dž are like the English sounds in ''ch''in, ''sh''in, vi''s''ion and ''j''uice.

The letters ď, ľ, ň, and ť are called “soft consonants” and are pronounced with the blade of the tongue at the roof of the mouth.

The letters c, dz and j are also soft, like ''ts'' in ba''ts'', ''ds'' in ro''ds'', and ''y'' in ''y''es.

Signs over a vowel show that the vowel is pronounced long: á, é, í, ó, ý ú. A long vowel is never followed in the next syllable by a short vowel.

The letter ô is like English ''wo''man, and ä is the same as the letter e.

The letter ch is like ''ch'' in Scottish lo''ch''. V is more like English ''w''.

The letters b, d, ď, dz, dž, g, h, z, ž are voiceless when they are at the end of a word (for example, 'd' will sound like 't').

The accent is always on the first syllable of the word. That is different from Russian, for example, in which the stress can be anywhere.

Like other Slavic languages, Slovak is difficult for English-speakers to pronounce., especially because several consonants often come together. In the sentence: “Strč prst skrz krk!” there is not one single vowel (it means: “Stick a finger through your neck!”)!

 Grammar 
The grammar is similar to Russian, but there are some differences. Slovak, unlike Russian, has a separate word for “to be”:
 Ja som Angličan (I am English).

Unlike English, Slovak does not have article (grammar)|articles (such as “the” and “a”).

There are three genders in Slovak, therefore it is important to know whether a noun is Masculine gender|masculine, Feminine gender|feminine or neuter. There is no article to make it obvious (unlike in German language|German), but it changes the adjective's ending.

Like many other European languages, Slovak verbs agree with the person, and there are different forms for 'I', 'you', 'he', etc. Verbs have different aspect (grammar)|aspects to show whether or not the action is complete. There are also different case (grammar)|cases that show how a word is used in a sentence. Different prepositions use different cases. All of that makes grammar quite complicated for English-speakers.
