The British Rail '''Class 206''' or '''3R''' was a type of diesel-electric multiple unit (DEMU) first created in 1964. They were re-formed from British Rail Class 201|Class 201 and British Rail Class 416|Class 416 vehicles for use on Reading railway station|Reading-Redhill, Surrey|Redhill-Tonbridge (North Downs Line) services. Six three-car sets were created, numbered '''1201–1206'''.  They were nicknamed 'Tadpole' units because of the contrast between the wide-bodied 416 'head' and the narrow-bodied 206 'tail'.
