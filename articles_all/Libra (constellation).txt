'''Libra''' (, symbol  to the east. It once represented the claws of Scorpius.

 Some features 
The '''brightest''' stars in Libra form a rectangle:

 Alpha Librae|α Librae, Zubenelgenubi ("southern claw"), a visual binary;
 Beta Librae|β Librae, Zubeneschamali ("northern claw");
 Gamma Librae|γ Librae, Zubenelakrab ("scorpion's claw");
 Sigma Librae|σ Librae, Brachium an eclipsing variable.

α and β Librae are the scales' balance beam, and γ and σ are the weighing pans.

σ Librae was formerly known as γ Scorpii even though it is well inside the boundaries of Libra. It was not renamed as σ Librae until 1851 (by Benjamin A. Gould).
