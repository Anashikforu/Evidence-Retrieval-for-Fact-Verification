A '''serpopard''' is a mythological animal, often seen carved on cosmetic palettes (used for mixing antimony as eye shadow), during the Old Kingdom of Egypt. These palettes were made in the earliest days of history, before the pharaohs. 

Serpopards stand approximately 3 feet tall at the shoulder; when their necks are fully extended, they can measure up to 20 feet long from nose to tail. They can weigh anywhere from 150 to 200 lbs. Some state that its appearance resembles a reptile's head on a long-necked lioness. The Serpopard has no markings on its body, round ears, and a tail that ends with a tuft of hair much like that of a lion.

A serpopard looks like a leopard; however it has a very long neck unlike a leopard. In the carved pictures, they are seen being led by ropes and harnesses while they serve the Egyptians as domesticated animals.  Skilled Egyptian artists always carved real animals in exactly the right shape, but the serpopard is thought to be only a mythological creature. In a later time, a similar creature would be shown  in the art of Sumer and Elam.Michael Rice, ''Egypt's Making: The Origins of Ancient Egypt, 5000-2000 BC'', Routledge 2003, p.68
