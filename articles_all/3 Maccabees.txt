The book of the '''3 Maccabees''' is found in most Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Bibles.
However, the book actually has nothing to do with the Maccabees. It does not have anything to do with their wikt:revolt|revolt against the Seleucid Empire, either (as described in 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees).  Instead, it tells the story of persecution of the Jews under Ptolemy IV of Egypt|Ptolemy IV Philopator (222-205 BC). The name of the book seems to come from the similarities between this book and the stories of the martyrdom of Eleazar (2 Maccabees)|Eleazar and the Woman with seven sons|Maccabeean youths in 2 Maccabees. The High Priest Shimon is also mentioned.
