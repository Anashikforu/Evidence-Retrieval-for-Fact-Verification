'''Attock Tehsil''' (. The Indus bounds it on the northwest, dividing it from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, while the Haro flows through from east to west. The northwest corner is occupied by the fertile Chach plain. South of this is a dry sandy plain, beyond which rises the Kala-Chitta range. The eastern half consists of the tract known as the Nala, which includes, along with a number of low hills and much broken country, a considerable area of fairly good level land, portions of which are irrigated from wells and by cuts from the Haro and other smaller streams.
