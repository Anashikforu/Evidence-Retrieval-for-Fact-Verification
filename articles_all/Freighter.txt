A '''cargo ship''' or '''freighter''' is any kind of ship that carries cargo, goods, and materials from one port to another. Thousands of cargo carriers travel on the world's seas and oceans each year, and handle most international trade. Cargo ships are usually specially designed for a special task, often carrying tools like crane (machine)|cranes to load and unload. They come in all sizes.
