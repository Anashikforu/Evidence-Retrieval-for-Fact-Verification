Uses of Beechwood
The beech has been used for its wood by man for thousands of years. The wood is white, or reddish if grown on acid soil, but fine grained, smooth and heavy when first cut. It may split as it dries. It is a good wood for making ornaments, tool handles, kitchen utensils, furniture and parts of buildings. Beechwood burns well and is used, among other woods, to smoke herrings in Scotland. It can also be made into charcoal.

Southern Beech
The southern beeches ''Nothofagus'' previously thought closely related to beeches, are now treated as members of a separate family, Nothofagaceae. They are found in Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Argentina and Chile (mostly on the southern tip in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego).

Pests and Diseases
The beech blight aphid (''Grylloprociphilus imbricator'') is a common pest of beech trees. Beeches are also used as food plants by some species of butterflies and moths (see :en: List of Lepidoptera that feed on beeches|List of moths and butterflies that feed on beech trees).
