'''Microsoft Office PowerPoint''' is a Presentation software|presentation program developed for the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS computer operating systems. Businesspeople, educators, and trainers use it often. It is a component of the Microsoft Office system.

 Operation 
In PowerPoint, as in most other presentation software, text, graphics, movies, and other objects are positioned on individual pages or "slides". The "slide" analogy is a reference to the slide projector. Slides can be printed, or (more often) displayed on-screen and navigated through at the command of the presenter. Slides can also form the basis of webcasts.

 Versions 
Versions for Microsoft Windows include:

 1993 PowerPoint 4.0 (Office 4.x)
 1995 PowerPoint 7 for Windows 95 (Office '95)
 1997 PowerPoint 97 (Office '97)
 1999 PowerPoint 2000 (Office 2000)

''Note: There is no PowerPoint 5.0 or 6.0, because the Windows 95 version was launched with Word 7. All of the Office 95 products have Object Linking and Embedding|OLE 2  - moving Information|data between many programs - and PowerPoint '''7''' shows that it was as new as Word '''7'''.''
