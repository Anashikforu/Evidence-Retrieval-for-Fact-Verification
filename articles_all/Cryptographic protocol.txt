A '''cryptographic protocol''' (also known as '''encryption protocol''' or '''security protocol''') is an abstract or an existing protocol (computing)|protocol that performs a information security|security-related function and applies cryptography|cryptographic methods. 

A protocol describes how the cryptography|cryptographic algorithms should be used to information security|secure information. The description of a protocol must include details about all data structures and representations, and all details about how to utilize the protocol by computer program|programs.

Cryptographic protocols are widely used for Security|secure application-level Data transmission|data transport, in order to Security|secure transferred messages. A cryptographic protocol usually has at least some of these features:
 Key generation.
 Entity authentication.
 Key-agreement protocol|Key agreement.
 Symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric encryption of transferred messages using the agreed generated key (cryptography)|key.

The Technical terminology|term ''cryptographic protocol'' is used in different ways. For example, cryptographic ''application'' protocols often use one or more underlying Key-agreement protocols which are also sometimes themselves referred to as "cryptographic protocols", like the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) which uses what is known as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Diffie-Hellman may be seen as a complete ''cryptographic protocol'' in itself for other applications.

 Examples 
 Diffie-Hellman key exchange
 Internet Key Exchange
 IPsec
 Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos V5
