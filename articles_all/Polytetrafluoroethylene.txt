In chemistry, '''Polytetrafluoroethylene''' (often shortened to '''PTFE''') is a polymer of tetrafluoroethylene. It is a fluoropolymer, because the polymerization is based on strong bond (chemistry)|bonds of fluorine and carbon. Polytetrafluoroethylene is not very reactive. It also repels oil and water. E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company developed it in 1938. It is better known by its trade-names, ''Teflon'', and '''Gore-Tex'''. Teflon is a coating done to frying pans, among others. Gore-Tex is a membrane used in clothing.

 Problems 
Perfluorooctanoic acid is needed to produce Polytetrafluoroethylene. Perfluorooctanoic acid is  because it is very toxic for people and may cause cancer. The precursors for many chemical weapons are highly corrosion|corrosive, their containers are therefore often treated with Polytetrafluoroethylene. For this reason, the export of Polytetrafluoroethylene from the European Union may need a special permit.
