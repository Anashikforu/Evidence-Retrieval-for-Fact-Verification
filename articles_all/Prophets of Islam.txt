'''Prophets in Islam''' () are those personalities whom Muslims consider to be chosen by Allah (God in Islam) to guide people. In Islamic terminology, they are called Nabi and Rasul or Mursal.

According to Islamic tradition, Allah has sent prophets to every nation. According to Islam , Muhammad was the only messenger sent to convey God's message to all mankind, and all other prophets were sent to one or more specific tribes or nations.

Judaism and Christianity , in contrast to Islam, the Prophet and Messenger of this is that, to obtain both divine revelation and the Holy Prophet (messengers) in the form of a book for a community of divine message was given, but not the Prophet who does not carry a book of Prophets. According to Islamic belief, the Prophets are the ones who are guaranteed by Allah to attain Paradise in the Hereafter.

Purpose of the Prophet's coming on this Earth
The prophets were sent on this Earth for a purpose. That was to call every one towards the one who created the entire creation. To call everyone towards the one who hears all. The one who sees all. The one who forgives. The most important message was to worship Allah alone and to follow his teachings. All of them, Adam, Nuh, Ibrahim, Ishaaq, Ismail, Musa, Haarun, Dawood, Sulaymaan, Isa, Muhammad, and others invited people to worship Allah alone and not to pray to idols and other false gods. All of the prophets were an example to lead moral, righteous, purpose-driven lives free of doubts and confusions.
