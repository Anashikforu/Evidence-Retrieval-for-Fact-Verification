The '''1968 Winter Olympics''', officially known as the '''X Olympic Winter Games''', were held in 1968 in Grenoble, France and started on February 6. Thirty-seven countries took part. Norway won the most medals, the first time a country other than the USSR had done so since the USSR first entered the Winter Games in 1956.
 Attention in the USA 
Frenchman Jean-Claude Killy won three gold medals in all the alpine skiing events. In women's figure skating, Peggy Fleming won the only United States gold medal. The games have been credited with making the Winter Olympics more popular in the United States, largely because of American Broadcasting Company|ABC's coverage of Fleming and Killy, who became very popular among teenage girls.

 New practices
