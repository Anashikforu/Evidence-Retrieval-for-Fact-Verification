 Show history 
= Original format =
''SmackDown!'' was first seen on April 29, 1999 as a single television special on UPN. On August 26, 1999, ''SmackDown!'' officially started on UPN, in Kansas City, Missouri. Like ''WCW Thunder'', ''SmackDown!'' was recorded on Tuesdays and then broadcast on Thursdays. The new WWF show was so popular that WCW moved ''Thunder'' to Wednesdays in the hope of holding on to fans rather than losing them to WWF. ''SmackDown!'', like ''Thunder'', made heavy use of the color blue, earning it the nickname "The Blue Show" amongst wrestling fans.

The first ''SmackDown!'' set was different as it had an oval-shaped Jumbotron|TitanTron (which was dubbed the "OvalTron"), entrance and stage which made it stand out from the ''RAW'' set and its rectangular TitanTrons. An added feature to the first set was the ability for the OvalTron to be moved to either the left or right of the stage. Throughout the show's early existence, top WWF superstar The Rock (entertainer)|The Rock routinely called ''SmackDown!'' "his" show, in reference to the fact that the name was derived from one of his catchphrases, "Laying the smackdown." In August 2001, as part of celebrating ''SmackDown!'''s second anniversary, the show got a new logo and set. The last ''SmackDown!'' to use the previous television set saw The Alliance (professional wrestling)|Alliance member Terry Gerin|Rhyno Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|Gore WWF member Chris Jericho through the center screen, destroying part of the set.

= Brand Extension =

In early to mid-2002, WWE had a process they called the "Brand Extension". WWE divided itself into two "de facto" wrestling promotions with separate rosters, storylines and authority figures. RAW and SmackDown! would host each division, give its name to the division and essentially compete against each other. The split was a result of WWF purchasing their two biggest competitors, WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW. The brand extension was publicly announced during a telecast of ''WWF RAW'' on March 25, 2002, and became official the next day.

Wrestlers now would become show-exclusive, wrestling for their specific show only. At the time this excluded the WWE Undisputed Championship and WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|WWE Women's Championship, as those WWE titles would be defended on both shows. In August 2002, WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar refused to defend the title on RAW, in effect causing his title to become exclusive to SmackDown! The following week on ''RAW'', General Manager Eric Bischoff awarded a newly instated World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship to RAW's designated #1 contender, Triple H. Due to the fact that since the WWE Undisputed Championship was now SmackDown! exclusive it was no longer seen as "Undisputed". Following this, the WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|WWE Women's Championship soon became RAW-exclusive as well. As a result of the Brand Extension, an annual "WWE Draft|draft lottery" was instituted to exchange members of each roster and generally refresh the lineups.

On June 6, 2005, WWE Champion John Cena switched brands from SmackDown! to RAW as part of the month-long WWE Draft#2005|Draft Lottery. This effectively left SmackDown! without a World Title. During this time, United States Champion Orlando Jordan was billed as the top champion on the show. On June 23, 2005, in Tucson, Arizona|Tucson, SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long announced a six-man elimination match between John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield, Booker Huffman|Booker T, Chris Benoit, The Undertaker, Christian (wrestler)|Christian (replacing Big Show|The Big Show, who was picked by RAW in the lottery), and Mark Copani|Muhammad Hassan to crown the first SmackDown! Champion. On the June 30 episode of ''SmackDown!'', JBL won the match. Long appeared afterward and stated that even though JBL had won the match, SmackDown! did not need a Championship anymore. Dave Bautista|Batista, the World Heavyweight Champion, entered the ring as SmackDown!'s final draft lottery pick. Long also showed that JBL was the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship.

= Friday Night SmackDown! =

It was possible that WWE's "lame duck" status with Viacom on Spike TV is what prompted its moving ''SmackDown!'' to the Friday night death slot for the Fall 2005 season. However, it worked out for both parties involved, as the show did better in the ratings than it had on Thursdays, while UPN got much better ratings on Fridays than it did before, with its movie night. Also, UPN had been able to hold on to the ratings from Thursday nights, most notably with comedian Chris Rock's ''The Wonder Years|Wonder Years''-like sitcom ''Everybody Hates Chris''. In January 2006, prior to the announcement of the CW Network, it was announced that UPN had renewed ''SmackDown!'' for two more years.

Following the cancellation of ''Star Trek: Enterprise'', ''SmackDown!'' was renamed ''Friday Night SmackDown!'' and moved into ''Enterprise'''s old timeslot in the United States. WWE promoted this move with the tagline "TV that's changing Friday nights." ''Friday Night SmackDown!'' made its start on September 9 2005. The program still aired on Thursdays in Canada on The Score (television network)|the Score. In the United Kingdom and Australia, their stations Sky Sports and FOX8 air ''SmackDown!'' on Fridays before the United States due to the time difference. This is the first time a major weekly WWE show airs internationally before it hits screens in the U.S.

The events of Hurricane Katrina affected the first version of ''Friday Night SmackDown!'' in the U.S. due to a special fundraising concert (see Shelter From the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast) that was shown on UPN at the same time that the first version would have been shown, resulting in only the second hour of the show being shown on UPN. The first hour was instead streamed from WWE's website. Other countries, including Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and the Philippines received the full two-hour show. WWOR-TV (My 9, New York, New York) also aired both hours of the show on tape delay on Saturday, due to a previous commitment to broadcast the New York Yankees on Friday nights.

At the ''SmackDown!'' taping on January 10 2006, Batista had to forfeit the World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship because of a triceps injury. Theodore Long made a Battle Royal for the vacant title. The winner was at the time RAW superstar Kurt Angle, who later switched to the SmackDown! brand. In a break from their traditional role of acting as if ''SmackDown!'' is not pre-recorded, WWE.com had a photograph of Angle holding his new title on the main page. WWE also did this when Edge (wrestler)|Edge cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to win the World Heavyweight Championship from The Undertaker and when The Great Khali won a battle royal after Edge (wrestler)|Edge's injury.

On the April 7 2006 version of ''SmackDown!'', general manager Theodore Long said that the King of the Ring tournament would return after a four-year hiatus as a ''SmackDown!''-exclusive tournament. The tournament ended at Judgment Day (2006)|Judgment Day 2006 with Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T as the winner, defeating Bobby Lashley in the final.

On June 9 2006, Tazz left the SmackDown! brand to join the new Extreme Championship Wrestling (WWE)|ECW brand, leaving the color commentator position on SmackDown! vacant. However, on June 11 at One Night Stand (2006)|One Night Stand 2006, JBL revealed that he would be the new color commentator for SmackDown! He stayed in that position until December 2007 when he left SmackDown! to become an in-ring competitor on WWE Raw|RAW. Jonathan Coachman replaced him afterwards.

The show is now seen on KUWB|KUCW. In Hawaii, ''SmackDown!'' returned in late 2006, airing on a CW digital subchannel of Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu's Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX affiliate KHON (Channel 2), which has received statewide carriage over Time Warner Cable|Oceanic Time Warner Cable.
