A '''plate''' is also one of the broken pieces of lithosphere of the Earth.

All plates have irregular shapes. They lie and float on the upper Mantle (geology)|mantle. They move very slowly in different directions. Their movement is driven by the convection currents in the magma.

A plate can contain both oceanic and continental crusts. Some contain oceanic crust only.
