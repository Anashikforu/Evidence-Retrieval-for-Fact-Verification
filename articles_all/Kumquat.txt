The '''kumquats''' or '''cumquats''' are a group of small fruit-bearing trees. The edible fruit (which is also called kumquat) is similar to other ''Citrus'' but is smaller.
Kumquats are slow-growing, evergreen shrubs or small trees, from 2.5–4.5 m tall, with dense branches. Sometimes they have small Spine (botany)|thorns. The leaf|leaves are dark glossy green, and the flowers pure white, similar to citrus flowers.
Kumquats came from China (they are known in literature of the 12th century), and have long been cultivated there and in Japan. They were introduced to Europe in 1846 by Robert Fortune, who was collector for the ''London Horticultural Society'', and a short time later into North America.
They are much hardier than citrus plants as orange (fruit)|oranges. The 'Nagami' kumquat needs a hot summer, ranging from 25 °C(77°F) to 38°C(100.4°F), but can withstand frost down to about -10 °C(14°F). It grows in the tea regions of China where the climate is too cold for other citrus fruits, even the Mikan (also known as the Satsuma) orange. 

Etymology
The English name "kumquat" derives from the Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese pronunciation ''gam1 gwat1'' (given in Jyutping romanization).  The alternate name 柑橘, also pronounced ''gam gwat'' in Cantonese (''gān jú'' in Standard Mandarin|Mandarin, literally "large tangerine orange") is now more commonly written by Cantonese speakers.

Names in other Asian languages include:
Japanese language|Japanese: ''kinkan'' (金柑)
Korean language|Korean: ''geumgyul'' (금귤)
Standard Mandarin|Mandarin: ''jīnjú'' (金橘)
Thai language|Thai: ''somchíd'' (ส้มจี๊ด)
Vietnamese language|Vietnamese: ''cam quất'' (from the Cantonese) or, less commonly, ''(quả) kim quất'' (if transliterated from the characters 金橘 into Sino-Vietnamese; "quả" (果) is the Sino-Vietnamese prefix for "fruit")
