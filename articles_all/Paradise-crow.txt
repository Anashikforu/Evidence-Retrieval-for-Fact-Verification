The '''paradise-crow''' (''Lycocorax pyrrhopterus'', also known as the '''silky crow''') is a medium-sized (approximately 34cm long) crow-like bird-of-paradise with all-dark, soft and silky plumage. It has a black Beak|bill, crimson eyes, and a call that sounds like a dog's bark. Both genders look about the same. The female is a little smaller than the male.

The paradise-crow is monogamous and can be found in the forests of the Maluku islands in Indonesia. They eat fruits and arthropods.
