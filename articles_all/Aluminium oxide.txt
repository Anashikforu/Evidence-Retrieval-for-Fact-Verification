'''Aluminium oxide''', also known as '''aluminum oxide''', is a chemical compound made from aluminium and oxygen. Its chemical formula is Al2O3. It is a normally white, powdery solid. It does not exist in a particular form. It can dissolve in acids and base (chemistry)|bases. It is used as an abrasive (sandpaper is an abrasive). It comes in bauxite and corundum. It does not melt easily. It is dissolved in a cryolite melt and electrolysis|electrolyzed to make aluminium.

Natural occurrence
Corundum is the most common naturally occurring crystallinity|crystalline form of aluminium oxide. ruby|Rubies and sapphires are types of corundum. The reason why they have different colors is because there are other elements in it.

Al2O3 is an Insulator (electricity)|electrical insulator but it has a high thermal conductivity (. Makeitfrom.com. Retrieved on 2013-04-17. Aluminium oxide is insoluble in water. Its most common occurring crystalline form, called corundum or α-aluminium oxide.

Aluminium oxide is the reason why aluminium cannot corrode. When aluminium reacts with atmospheric oxygen, a thin layer of aluminium oxide (4&nbsp;nm thickness) forms on any exposed aluminium surface. This layer protects the metal from more oxidation.

Aluminium oxide is an amphoteric substance, meaning it can react with both acids and base (chemistry)|bases, such as hydrofluoric acid and sodium hydroxide.
