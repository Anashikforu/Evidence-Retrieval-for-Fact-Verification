'''''Last of the Summer Wine''''' is a British sitcom. It ran longer than any other comedy show in the UK and longer than any other sitcom in the world.

''Last of the Summer Wine'' was filmed in and around Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England. It features three older men who never get old and act like they are children. The three originally were Norman Clegg (Peter Sallis), Cyril Blamire (Michael Bates), and Compo Simmonite (Bill Owen). After two years, Blamire left the show. In his place, Brian Wilde joined as Foggy Dewhurst. The current cast is Russ Abbot as Hobbo Hobdyke, Burt Kwouk as Entwistle, and Brian Murphy as Alvin Smedley.

Some think the show is not as good as it used to be. There have been many Christmas in the media|holiday specials, two television movies, and a documentary movie about the series. ''Last of the Summer Wine'' has inspired other adaptations, including a television wikt:prequel|prequel,Bright and Ross (2000), p. 160 several novelization|novelisations,Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;24 and a stage adaptation.Bright and Ross (2000), pp. 24â€“25
