'''New Zealand English''' is the English spoken in New Zealand. The words are mostly the same as in British English, but are pronounced (spoken) differently. 

Some words are only found in New Zealand English. These include ''dairy'' (corner shop; small grocery shop), ''bach'' (small holiday house, usually by the beach), and ''heaps'' (lots of, i.e "I ate heaps of pavlova last Christmas").
