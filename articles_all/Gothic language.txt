The '''Gothic language''' is an extinct Germanic language that was spoken by the Goths. It is the East Germanic language with the most texts surviving today. It had died out by the 8th century or perhaps the early 9th century.

Probably, one of the best known works of the language is Ulfilas|Wulfila's translation of the Bible, known as the Wulfila Bible or ''Gothic Bible'' or ''Codex Argenteus''. The translation was done in the 3rd century.
