This is a list of the '''highest mountains in the world'''. There are at least 109 mountains on Earth that are higher than  above sea level. Most of these are in central or southern Asia. It is hard to measure how tall a mountain is, so these wikt:measurement|measurements may not be exact. It is also hard to figure out if two peaks close to each other are part of the same mountain or are two different mountains.
