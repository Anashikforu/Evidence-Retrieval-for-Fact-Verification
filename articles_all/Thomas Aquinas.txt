'''St. Thomas Aquinas''', (1225 – 7 March 1274) was a Catholic Dominican Order|Dominican priest from Italy, and is a Catholic saint and philosopher. He was born in Roccasecca, as the son of Count Andulf of Aquino and Countess Theodora of Teano.

His early education was at the Benedictine monastery at Monte Cassino. He attended the University of Naples, where he got the nickname "dumb ox" for his slow demeanor, though he was an intelligent and talented student. He studied philosophy, Catholic theology, church history, liturgy, and canon law. 

By 1240, he became interested in the religious life and decided to become a friar with the new Dominican Order. His family captured him and brought him back because to become a Dominican one must eliminate material wealth. His parents expected him to follow in his uncle’s footsteps and become a Benedictine abbot. They kept him in a castle in an effort to change his mind. However, when they released him two years later, he immediately joined the Dominicans.Haber, Katharine. "Thomas Aquinas." World History: Ancient and Medieval Eras. ACB-CLIO, 2013. Web. 27 Feb. 2013.
