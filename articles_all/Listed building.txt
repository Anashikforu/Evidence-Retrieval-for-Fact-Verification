A '''listed building''', in the United Kingdom, is a building that has been placed on the '''Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest'''. This is a list of buildings that are important in terms of architecture, history, or culture. There are many buildings on this list. In the UK, there are about 500,000 listed buildings.

In England and Wales, there are three kinds of listed buildings:
 '''Grade I''': buildings that are very important
 '''Grade II''': buildings that are important in general (not special interest)
 '''Grade II''': buildings that are special interesting (this means that they are important to some groups or for a specific reason)
There used to be a fourth kind of listed building: '''Grade III'''. This type has not been used since 1970.
