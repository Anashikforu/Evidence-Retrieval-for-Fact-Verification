'''Cernunnos''' (also spelt as '''Cernenus'''
Cernunnos is linked with male animals with horns, especially stags (a type of animal). Because of this, he is linked with fertility. Cernunnos is also seen as God of the Underworld.

Everything that we know about Cernunnos comes from two pictures; one from France, and one from Germany.
