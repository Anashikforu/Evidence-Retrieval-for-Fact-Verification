'''Gustav Klimt''' (14 July 1862 – 6 February 1918) was an Austrian Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painter. He was one of the most prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement. His major works include paintings, murals, sketches, and other art objects. Many of them are on display in the Vienna Secession gallery. Klimt's primary subject was the female body," The most important element of his fame is his reputation as a master of eroticism". Fleidel, Gottfried: "Gustav Klimt 1862-1918 The World in Female Form.", p. 14. Benedikt Taschen, 1994. and his works are marked by a frank eroticism — nowhere is this more apparent than in his numerous drawings in pencil (see ''Mulher sentada'', below).Sabarsky, Serge, et al., ''Gustav Klimt: Drawings, p. 18. Moyer Bell Limited, 1983. ''

Klimt died of influenza in Vienna in 1918.
