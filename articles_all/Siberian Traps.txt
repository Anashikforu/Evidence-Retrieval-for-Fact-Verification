The '''Siberian Traps''' form a large region of volcanic rock, known as a large igneous province, in the Russian region of Siberia. 

The large Volcanic eruption|eruptions which formed the traps were one of the largest known volcano|volcanic events of the last 500&nbsp;million years of Earth history. They continued for a million years and spanned the Permian-Triassic boundary, about 251 to 250&nbsp;million years ago. It was the same time as the Permian–Triassic extinction event, which is estimated to have killed 90% of species existing at the time. The eruption of the Siberian Traps is a possible cause of this "Great Dying".

The term "traps" is derived from the Swedish language|Swedish word for stairs (''trappa'', or sometimes ''trapp''), referring to the step-like hills forming the landscape of the region, which is typical of flood basalts.

 Geographical extent 
Vast volumes of basaltic lava paved over a large expanse of primaeval Siberia in a flood basalt event. Today the area covered is about 2&nbsp;million km² – roughly equal to western Europe in land area – and estimates of the original coverage are as high as 7&nbsp;million km². The original volume of lava is estimated to range from 1 to 4&nbsp;million km³.

Origin
The source of the Siberian Traps basalt was, probably, a mantle plume at the base of the crust which erupted through the Siberian craton (the oldest part of the Siberian tectonic plate|continental plate). Helium isotope analysis from the basalts indicates a plume origin. The scientific debate continues.Czamanske, Gerald K.; Fedorenko, Valeri A. 
 The Great Dying 

This massive eruptive event spanned the Permian-Triassic boundary, about 250 million years ago, and is widely cited as a cause of the Permian-Triassic extinction event.  This extinction event, also called the Great Dying, affected all life on Earth, and is estimated to have killed 90% of species living at the time.
 Life on land took 30 million years to recover from the environmental disruptions caused by the eruption of the Siberian Traps.{{ cite journal | url= | author=Sahney, S. and Benton, M.J. | year=2008

 Siberian Traps and nickel 
The Siberian Traps are considered to have erupted through numerous vents over a period of a million years or more, probably east and south of Norilsk in Siberia. The giant Norilsk nickel-copper-palladium deposit formed within the magma flows in the main Siberian Traps. The presence of extensive tuff and pyroclastic deposits suggests that a number of large explosive eruptions occurred during or before the eruptions of basaltic lavas. The presence of silica|silicic volcanic rocks such as rhyolite is also indicative of explosive eruptions.
