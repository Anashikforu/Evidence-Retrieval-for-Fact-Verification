 Description 

Link wears a green shirt and a long, floppy green hat on his head. In the Legend of Zelda games, the player must use Link to fight against evil, especially Ganondorf. Although Link is the main character in the game, he never speaks (he does speak in the Legend of Zelda CD-I games). He is also left-handed, and has large ears, like most Hyrule|Hylians. He has also appeared in all 6 of the ''Super Smash Bros. (series)|Super Smash Bros.'' games. Link mainly used a sword and a shield but he is able to use a large number of weapons like bombs, bow, hammer or a boomerang and the hook shot.

 Reception 

Link has been in many GameFAQs "Character Battle" contests and is the only character to have won more than once.
