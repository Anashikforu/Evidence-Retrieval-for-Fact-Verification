History
The former List of Provinces of Japan|provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures between 1876 and 1879.Louis-Frédéric|Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2002). 
The word ''todōfuken'' combines the suffixes of the names of the 47 prefectures. The four suffixes are: 

 -''to ....'' one metropolis, or large city (都 -''to''), Tokyo (東京都, ''Tōkyōto'') 

 
''-dō'' .... one “circuit” (道 ''-dō''), Hokkaido (北海道, ''Hokkaidō'')
''-fu'' .... two city prefectures (府 ''-fu''), Osaka (大阪府, ''Ōsakafu'') and Kyoto (京都府, ''Kyōtofu'')
''-ken'' ... forty-three other prefectures (県 ''-ken'')
Before World War II, different laws applied to ''fu'' and ''ken,'' but now two types of prefecture are the same, outside of their names.

The prefectures are often grouped into these nine List of regions of Japan|regions (''Chihō''). The regions are not formally specified, they do not have elected officials, and they are not corporate bodies.  However, the practice of ordering prefectures based on their geographic region is traditional.  This ordering is mirrored in Japan's International Organization for Standardization (ISO) coding.See ISO 3166  From north to south, the prefectures of Japan and their commonly associated regions are listed in traditional and in ISO 3166-2:JP order:
