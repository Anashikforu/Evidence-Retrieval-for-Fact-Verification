The '''Lauraceae''' or '''laurel family''' is a group of flowering plants in the order Laurales. It includes the bay laurel and its closest relatives. 

The family has over 3000 species of flowering plants in over 50 genera worldwide. They mostly live in warm temperate and tropical regions, especially southeast Asia and South America. Most are aromatic evergreen trees or shrubs, but one or two genera such as ''Sassafras'' are deciduous, and ''Cassytha'' is a genus of parasite|parasitic vines.
