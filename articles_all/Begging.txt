'''Begging''' means asking people for money, food, shelter or other things, when one is not able to give anything instead. It is also referred to as '''sponging''', '''spanging''' (short for "spare-changing") or (in American English) '''panhandling'''.

In larger cities, it is common to see beggars who ask for money, food, or other items. Typically, beggars often beg for spare change using coffee cups, mugs, small boxes, hats, or other items into which monies can be placed and sometimes display signs with messages such as "Help me. I'm homeless."

 Use of funds obtained by begging 

A 2002 study of 54 panhandlers in Toronto reported that of a median monthly income of $638 Canadian dollar|CAD, those interviewed spent a median of $200 CAD on food and $192 CAD on alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs.
''Income and spending patterns among panhandlers'', by Rohit Bose and Stephen W. Hwang.

Because of this, some people say that it would be better to give the beggars gift cards or food/service vouchers, instead of money.

 Aggressive panhandling 
'''Aggressive panhandling''' means to ask for donations or help in a threatening manner. This is not mugging, but rather similar and therefore often forbidden by law. Examples include:
 Asking customers inside a store or restaurant.
 Extending a hand, or even the head and both arms, into a car window
 Asking after dark, in a secluded area.
 There have been reports of beggars who will try to have their limbs amputation|amputated in the hope that they can get more out of sympathy.
