'''Lethal injection''' is injection|injecting a person, particularly a dangerous criminal with poison, usually a fatal dose of drugs so the person will die. This is usually done as capital punishment. It is the main way to execute prisoners in the United States. Texas was the first state to actually use lethal injection for an execution. This first happened when Charlie Brooks was executed in 1982. Thirty-four US states now use it for capital punishment. Other countries to use it are China, Taiwan, and Guatemala.

Lethal injection is usually done by using three chemicals. The chemicals are usually sodium thiopental (an anesthetic), pancuronium bromide (used to paralyze the person being injected), and potassium chloride (to stop the heart so that the person being injected death|dies).
