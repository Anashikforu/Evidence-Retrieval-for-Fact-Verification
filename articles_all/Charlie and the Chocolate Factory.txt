'''''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''''' (1964) is a children's book by United Kingdom|British author Roald Dahl.  This story of the adventures of young Charlie Bucket inside the chocolate factory of eccentric candymaker Willy Wonka is often considered one of the most beloved children's stories of the 20th century. It has been made into a movie twice.

 Plot 

Only five children were to win a golden ticket and to be allowed inside the Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Those who won the lottery would get a magical tour and see all the mysterious machinery in the factory where the world's most wonderful candy|sweets are made. The lucky five were the greedy Augustus Gloop, the spoiled Veruca Salt, the gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde, the smart-alecky Mike Teavee and the poor Charlie Bucket. One by one, the children break Wonka's rules by acting on a vice they possess, with Charlie ending up a hero of the story. The movie teaches about sins and virtues.

Problems
 In early editions of the book, the Oompa-Loompas are described as African Pygmy people|pygmies. This caused controversy and criticism. In later editions of the book, they have white skin and golden hair. (In the 1971 movie, they have orange skin).
