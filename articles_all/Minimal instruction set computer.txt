'''Minimal Instruction Set Computer''' ('''MISC''') is a CPU design|processor architecture with a very small number of basic Instruction (computer science)|instruction operations and corresponding opcodes.  As a result of this is a smaller instruction set, a smaller and faster instruction set Parsing|decode unit, and faster operation of individual Instruction (computer science)|instructions.  The disadvantage is that smaller instruction set always have more sequential dependencies, reducing instruction-level parallelism.
