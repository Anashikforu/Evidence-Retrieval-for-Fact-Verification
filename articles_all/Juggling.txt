'''Juggling''' is a skill where a person (the ''juggler'') keeps objects (''props'') moving for a long time, using their hands or other parts of their body. The most common props are balls (or beanbags), clubs and rings. Some jugglers use more dangerous-looking objects such as knives, fire torches and chainsaws. There are other kinds of juggling prop such as diabolos, Yo-yo|yo-yos, Poi spinning|poi, devil sticks, cigar boxes, foot bags and Hat|hats. Some jugglers use bouncing objects. 

Juggling can be for entertainment, art or sport.
