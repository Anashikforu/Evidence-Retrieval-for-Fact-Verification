'''Quolls''' (genus '''''Dasyurus''''') are carnivorous|meat-eating marsupials native to Australia and Papua New Guinea. The name ''dasyurus'' means "hairy tail." Adults are between 25 and 75 cm long, with hairy tails about 20-35 cm long (about the size of a cat). Females have pouch to carry their babies.

Quolls are threatened by eating toxic cane toad|cane toads, but a  University of Sydney project is teaching them not to eat them.

The family Dasyurini to which quolls belong also  includes the Tasmanian devil, antechinuses, the kowari, and  mulgaras.
