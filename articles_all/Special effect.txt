'''Special effects''' are used in movies to create images that do not exist. There are many different types of special effects, for example, making little Scale model|models or using computer animation.

Action movies often use special effects to create images that would be dangerous or cost a lot of money. For example, if an action movie shows a very big warship|battleship blowing up, it would be expensive to buy a battleship and dangerous to blow it up. Most action movies use special effects if they want to show something blow up. It is cheaper and safer to make a little model of a battleship and blow that up. 

Science fiction, fantasy, and horror movie|horror movies also often use special effects. They usually tell imaginary stories, often set in imaginary places, that would be impossible to film. For example, in a science fiction movie about a world with three suns, artists could create a computer image of three suns which would appear in the wikt:background|background. 

Using a computer to create special effects is called "computer generated imagery" (CGI) or "computer animation". Most science fiction movies from the 2000s use a lot of CGI.
