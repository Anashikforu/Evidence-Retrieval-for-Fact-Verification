Paralympians

Paralympians have many different kinds of disabilities, so there are several categories in which they compete.  The disabilities are in six broad categories: amputee, cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, wheelchair, visually impaired, and ''Les Autres'' (This means "the others" in French language|French.) These categories are further broken down which vary from sport to sport.

Paralympians work for equal treatment with able-bodied Olympians. Olympians receive much more money than Paralympians. Some Paralympians have also participated in the Olympic Games.
