'''Dynamic-link library''' (also written as '''D'''ynamic '''L'''ink '''L'''ibrary or '''DLL'''), is the Microsoft's implementation of shared library|shared libraries used by the Microsoft Windows operating systems. These libraries usually have the file extension DLL, OCX (for libraries containing ActiveX controls), or DRV (for Windows legacy Device driver|system drivers).

Any of the Microsoft Windows data computer file|files having the same file format as that of the ''Dynamic-link library'' can be called a ''resource DLL''. Examples of such DLLs include ''Icon (computing)|icon libraries'', sometimes having the extension ICL, and the font files, having the extensions FON and FOT.
