'''Tropical Storm Nana''' was the fourteenth Tropical cyclone|tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm formed in early October from a tropical wave with a nearby low pressure area. The wave moved west-northwest with a small amount of convection, before being completely organized enough to become a tropical depression while  west of the Cape Verde Islands. It became a tropical storm later that same day, and began weakening almost right away thereafter as it moved in to an area of higher Wind shear|vertical wind shear. The storm  finally died out early on October 15. Nana did not have an effect on any land areas or ships.

Storm history


A tropical wave moved west, awat from the western coast of Africa on October 6. This wave continued moving west with just a little bit of convection until October 8, when organized cloud bands began to form around its low-level center. The wave continued moving westward and organizing until it was called a tropical depression early on October 12,  west of the Cape Verde Islands. east-northeast of the Leeward Islands.

Forecasting, impact, naming, and records
Tropical Storm Nana's tropical cyclogenesis|formation was expected for a few days before it actually developed. Movement and strength predictions were also better than the long term average. Because of Nana's short life the sample size is not very meaningful. Tropical Storm Nana stayed in the middle of the Atlantic and never came near land. As a result, it had no known impact. No ships reported strong winds that came from the tropical storm.
