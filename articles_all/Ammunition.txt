'''Ammunition''', often called '''ammo''', comes from the French language|French word ''la munition''. At first it meant all items used for war. This was from the Latin word ''munire'' (to provide). It now is used only for bullets and other projectiles that are thrown at the enemy by guns, and the gunpowder or other propellant that throws the projectiles. The group word for all types of ammunition is '''munitions'''. This means any explosive thing that can be used in combat and includes bombs, missiles, warheads, and mines (land mine|landmines, naval mines, and claymore mines). These are made in munitions factories. 

Ammunition is mainly used to attack a target. Ammunition can include flares and incendiary devices that start fires.  Since the invention of the Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge, ammunition has come to mean the putting of a projectile - the item that is sent to hit the target, and its gunpowder|propellant - the chemical that creates the force, into a single package. 

Ammunition is a complex subject.  It includes many different weapons used by people, such as Explosive material|explosives and Propellant#Solid_propellant_rockets_and_projectiles|propellants, cartridges, Explosive_material#High_explosives|high explosive projectiles (HE), warheads, special shells to attack armour and Anti-aircraft warfare|aircraft, carrier projectiles, fuses, mortar (weapon)|mortar ammunition, small arms (revolver and pistol) ammunition, hand grenade|grenades, mines, flares, improved Conventional weapon|conventional munitions, and computer guided munition.
