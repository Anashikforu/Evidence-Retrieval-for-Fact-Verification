The Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation SR Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification|'''5BEL''' to the 5-car all-George Pullman|Pullman electric multiple units built to work the prestigious '''Brighton Belle''' trains between London Victoria and Brighton. These units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated TOPS '''Class 403'''. Between 1933 and 1935 the units were designated '''5PUL''' (the 'PUL' code was then used for the SR Class 6Pul|6PUL units).
