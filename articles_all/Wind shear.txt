'''Wind shear''' is a difference in either wind speed or direction over a fairly short distance in the atmosphere. Wind shear can be divided into two different types: ''horizontal'' and ''vertical wind shear''.

When wind shear is observed
Weather situations when the Wind shear is observed happen:
At ''weather fronts'' when the temperature difference across the front is 5 Â°C or more, and the front moves at 15 Knot (speed)|kt or faster. 
At ''low level jets'' when a significant low level vertical wind shear can develop near the lower portion of the low level jet.  
At ''mountains'' when winds blow over and create vertical shear on the lee side.National Center for Atmospheric Research. At ''inversions'' when on a clear and calm night a radiation inversion is formed near the ground.  
At ''downbursts'' when an outflow boundary moves away from a thunderstorm.
At ''sailing'' when wind shear affects sailboats by presenting a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the sailing mast.
