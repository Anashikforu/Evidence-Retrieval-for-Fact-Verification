The British Rail '''Class 91''' is a class of 140&nbsp;mph, 6,300&nbsp;horsepower|hp electric locomotives ordered specifically for the East Coast Main Line modernisation and electrification programme of the late 1980s. Built to replace the previous British Rail Class 43 (HST)|Class 43 (better known as the InterCity 125), the Class&nbsp;91s were given the auxiliary name of '''InterCity 225''' to indicate their status as a new version of the 125 and their envisaged top speed of 225&nbsp;km/h (140&nbsp;mph). The other end of the InterCity 225 train set is formed of a Driving Van Trailer, built with a similar bodyshell to the Class 91 locomotives.
