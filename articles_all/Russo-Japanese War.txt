The '''Russo-Japanese War''' (Russian : Русско-Яионская Война) (Japanese : 日露践祚) (Korean : 러일전쟁)  between the Empire of Japan and the Russian Empire between 1904 and 1905. The Japanese won the war, and the Russians lost.

The war happened because the Russian Empire and the Empire of Japan disagreed over who should get parts of Manchuria and Korea. The war was fought mostly on the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden, the seas around Korea, Japan, and the Yellow Sea. The politics of both countries in the war were very complicated, but both wanted to gain land and economic benefits.

The Chinese Empire of the Qing Dynasty was large but weak, and it was Qing land and possessions that were fought over. For example, Korea had been under Qing rule but was seized by Japan. Russia wanted a warm-water port on the Pacific Ocean for its navy and trade. The harbour at Vladivostok freezes over in the winter, but Port Arthur (now part of Dalian on the Liaodong Peninsula in China) can be used all year round. Russia had already rented the port from the Qing and had got permission to build a Trans-Siberian railway from St Petersburg to Port Arthur.

 Causes 
Russia wanted a warm-water Pacific Ocean port for trade and its navy. Japan wanted to expand her empire into Korea and China. Japan thought that when Russia completed its railway in 1906, it would be able to beat Japan in a war by being able to supply large numbers of troops there.  

To avoid war, Japan wanted to compromise with Russia even if it got the better deal. Japan wanted a more of Korea and China than it thought Russia would offer. Japan decided to attack before the railway was complete so that it could do well in a war against Russia.

The war started with a Japanese surprise attack on Port Arthur and continued with Japanese victories in Manchuria and elsewhere. The last major battle was at Tsushima Strait and destroyed the Russian Navy.

 Peace treaty and aftermath 
US President Theodore Roosevelt helped Russia and Japan make Treaty of Portsmouth|peace after the war. That made him win a Nobel Prize. Russia had to give up all influence in the Far East. The Russian people were very angry at the government and at Tsar Nicholas II for not continuing the war because everyone was sure that Russia could have won. That is true because Japan was bankrupt and would have suffered an economic crisis after just a few more months of fighting. Russia's army was also much stronger than Japan's and had very large reserves to replace the soldiers she lost. However, Japan had no men with military training to replace its losses and no money to give new men training.

The Japanese got Port Arthur and the Russian railway in Manchuria. Five years later, in 1910, Japan took over Korea.

 War’s Between The Soviet Union and Japan from 1932-1945

On 11 May 1939 a Mongolian Cavalry wondered over the border in Manchukuo however this caused the Japanese to chase of the intruder’s and this lead to the Battle of Khalkhin Gol|Battle of Khalkhin Gol (1939) which lasted until 16 September 1939  (today a forgotten battle) . On the 9 August 1945 the Soviet Union invaded Manchuria,Korea|Japanese Korea (Today North Korea and South Korea) and Sakhalin and Japan surrendered on the 3 September 1945 .
