'''Holly''' is a type of shrub|bush with recognisable leaves. The leaves have sharp edges, and are often used to decorate a house on Christmas Day. Some types of holly are used to make tea. The leaves of the Holly don't fall of in the winter because they're very thick and have a waxy layer on them.
Holly bushes produce berries that birds often eat during the winter season.
