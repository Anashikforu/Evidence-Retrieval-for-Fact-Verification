In sociology, '''Social class''' refers to the hierarchy|hierarchical distinctions between individuals or groups in society|societies or culture|cultures.

There are various ways to divide classes. The ''working class'' do hard work for others. Where money is used, they are paid for it, but they seldom have much money. Where money is used little, as in feudalism, or not at all, as in the Inca Empire there are still classes.

Historians usually see two other groups - people who are rich or have a lot of influence, called the ''upper class'', and all the remaining people who are in between, called the ''middle class''.

Not all societies have social classes. Scientists have found no proof for hierarchical power structures during the Stone Age.Gowdy, John (2006) "Hunter-gatherers and the mythology of the market," in Richard Borshay Lee|Richard B. Lee and Richard H. Daly (eds.), The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Hunters and Gatherers, pp.391-394. New York: Cambridge University Press
