'''Asimo''' was a robot that was built by Honda. The current models could walk, run, and go up and down stairs. Engineers planned to add laser capabilities. Its height was 130 centimeters (4 feet 3 inches) and weight 54 kilograms (119 pounds). Asimo was just like an astronaut wearing a backpack and could walk or run on two feet. 


 Development 
ASIMO was created at Honda's Research & Development ''Wako Fundamental Technical Research Center'' in Japan. Honda will not confirm how much it costs.

 Name 
ASIMO is an acronym.  ASIMO stands for "'''A'''dvanced '''S'''tep in '''I'''nnovative '''MO'''bility". It should be pronounced “ah she moh” to match the original Japanese pronunciation.

As of February 2009, there are over 100 ASIMO units in existence.
