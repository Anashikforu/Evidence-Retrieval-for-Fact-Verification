The '''Shahadah''' () is the first pillar of Islam. The saying is "''Lā ʾIlāha ʾIllā Allah, Muḥammadun Rasūl Allah"'', meaning "There is no deity but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God". The Shia and Quraniyoon sects may have slight differences in their shahada. The Later Mughals by William Irvine p. 130
