In cryptography, a '''secure channel''' is a way of Transmitter|transferring data that is very difficult (called r''esistant'') to overhear or copy (called ''interception'') and understand (called ''decrypt'') or change (called ''tampering'').

A '''confidential channel''' is a way of transferring data that is resistant to interception, but may not be resistant to tampering and may not be resistant to impersonation by someone else (called ''spoofing'').

An '''authenticatable channel''' is a way of transferring data that is resistant to spoofing but may not be resistant to interception or tampering.
