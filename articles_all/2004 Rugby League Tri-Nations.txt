The format of the competition was different from the 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations|previous event.  In that event the teams played each other twice instead of once before the final.

The tournament final of the tournament was predicted by some to be a close affair. The British team was considered a small favourite after finishing at the top of the league table. Instead, it was a one-sided match as Australia produced their best performance of the tournament. The game was basically over by half-time when Australia led by 38-0.
