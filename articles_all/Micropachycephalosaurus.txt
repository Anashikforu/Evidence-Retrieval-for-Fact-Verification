'''''Micropachycephalosaurus, a''''' tiny thick headed lizard, is a genus of ornithischian dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous. It was a herbivore, and lived in what is now Shandong, China. It was one of the smallest dinosaur ever discovered, just over a meter long, but with the longest name. Before it was discovered ''Compsognathus'' was the smallest known dinosaur.Butler R.J. and Zhao Q. 2009. The small-bodied ornithischian dinosaurs ''Micropachycephalosaurus hongtuyanensis'' and ''Wannanosaurus yansiensis'' from the Late Cretaceous of China. ''Cretaceous Research'' '''30'''(1):63-77. doi:10.1016/j.cretres.2008.03.002

The lack of the skull roof means the fossil cannot be placed at Family (biology)|family level. It might or might not be a pachycephalosaur. Butler and Zhao therefore classified it as an indeterminate member of the Cerapoda. In 2011, Cladistics|cladistic analysis showed that ''Micropachycephalosaurus'' is a basal member of the Ceratopsia. In this context, basal does not mean 'wikt:ancestor|ancestral'; the fossil is far too late for that. It means simply 'unspecialized', or lacking Derived (biology)|derived Trait (biology)|traits.
