 Main events 
In 675 Osric, King of the Hwicce, granted the Abbess Berta 100 hides near Bath for the establishment of a convent. This religious house later became a monastery under the patronage of the Bishop of Worcester.
William II of England|William Rufus granted Bath, Somerset to a royal physician, John of Tours, who became Bishop of Wells and Abbot of Bath. In 1090 he moved his seat from Wells to Bath Abbey, which therefore became a cathedral.
The church became a ruin, and was restored just before the dissolution of the monasteries. Then it was stripped of lead, iron and glass, before being restored again by Elizabeth I.
Restoration from 1860 to the present day has brought the church up to a high standard.
From the 13th century the seat of the bishops has usually been in Wells Cathedral, even though the city of Bath is much larger than Wells. The bishopric has been joined as 'Bath and Wells' since 1245.
