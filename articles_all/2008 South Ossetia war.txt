The '''2008 South Ossetia war''' was a military conflict that started on 8 August 2008, between Georgia (country)|Georgia, South Ossetian (and Abkhazian) secessionists and Russia.

Neither state has been diplomatic recognition|diplomatically recognised by any member of the United Nations. The conflict began on August 8, 2008, after Georgia claimed South Ossetian separatists had broken a ceasefire by attacking villages, although South Ossetian officials deny that they attacked villages. Georgia launched a military offensive to surround and capture the capital of Republic of South Ossetia|South Ossetia, Tskhinvali.
