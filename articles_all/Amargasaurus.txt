'''''Amargasaurus''''' was a sauropod from the early Cretaceous period. It grew to 10 meters (33 feet) length, which was relatively small for a sauropod. It was a quadrupedal herbivore with a long, low skull on the end of a long neck, much like its relative ''Dicraeosaurus''.

''Amargasaurus'' was found in La Amarga (Province)|La Amarga, a canyon in  Neuqu√©n Province, Argentina.

 Features 
''Amargasaurus'' had two tall rows of spines on top of its backbone along the neck and back.Novas, Fernando E. 2009. ''The age of dinosaurs in South America''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press.  The function of the spines is not known. They may have operated as a defence from theropod attack from above. Another idea is that they supported a sail-like structure.

The neural spines were bifurcated along their entire length, forming a double row.
