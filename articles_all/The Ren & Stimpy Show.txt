'''The Ren and Stimpy Show''' is an American cartoon created by John Kricfalusi, which aired from 1991 to 1999. The main characters are Ren HÃ¶ek (Maurice LaMarche), a chihuahua, and Stimpy|Stimpson J. Cat (Billy West) (Stimpy for short).

The show premiered on Nickelodeon on Sunday, August 11, 1991, and aired new episodes on the channel from 1991 to 1996.

The series ended on October 20, 1996, with the episodes "Sammy and Me" and "Last Temptation".

It was also shown on MTV, and was shown in other countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and most of Europe.

People who make cartoons think that ''Ren and Stimpy'' is famous because of its classic cartoonish style and gross humor that is different from other animated shows at the time, and then became a cult following. John Kricfalusi got fired after only one year of working on his show. He did not send his work on time and often fought with his friends at Nickelodeon, so they fired him. He made other shows but none were as popular as ''Ren and Stimpy''.

Reruns of ''Ren and Stimpy'' currently air on the Nicktoons Network.
