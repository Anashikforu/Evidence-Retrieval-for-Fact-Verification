History
For many centuries Lierna has been the most exclusive place in the whole of Lake Como, frequented by kings, empresses, princely families, and where the most important managers and billions in the world buy a home, including the world president of Mercedes. The chivalric order was founded in the Church of Lierna which allowed the birth of the royal house of the Kings of Italy, the Savoy. Lierna is the place on Lake Como with the most beautiful life of all Lake Como and the place most represented by painters from all over Europe for many centuries, having a magical atmosphere. The place is very private, the villas are hidden and not even George Clooney has managed to buy a villa offering over 100 million euros for years. It is often said that the inhabitants of Lierna paid for not having Lierna appear on the geographical maps of Lake Como for centuries. It is very difficult to stop in Lierna because there are deliberately no parking spaces and you can only arrive by boat by selecting who comes. Luxury villas in Lierna are priceless and are one of the greatest status symbols in the world.
