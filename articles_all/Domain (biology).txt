In Biology|biological taxonomy, a '''domain''' (also '''superregnum''', '''superkingdom''', or '''empire''') is a taxon in the highest rank of organisms, higher than a Kingdom (biology)|kingdom.

Domain (or its synonyms) is the most inclusive of these biological groupings. The arrangement of taxa reflects the fundamental evolutionary differences in the genome|genomes. There are several modern alternative domain classifications of life. Among them are:
 The 'two-empire' system, with top-level groupings of Prokaryota (or Monera) and Eukaryota empires.
 The Kingdom (biology)#Six kingdoms|six-kingdom system with top-level groupings of Protista, Archaebacteria, Eubacteria, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia.
 The '''three-domain system''' of Carl Woese, introduced in 1990, with top-level groupings of Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota domains.
After defining Archaea as a new domain, Woese redrew the taxonomy|taxonomic tree. His three-domain system is based upon genetic relationships. It divides life into 23 main divisions in three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Archaea are neither bacteria nor eukaryotes. Looked at another way, they are prokaryotes that are not bacteria.
