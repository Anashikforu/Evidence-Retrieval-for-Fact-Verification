'''Impressment'''  ('''the Press''') was the act of forcing men to serve in the navy.  The people who were "pressed" to join the navy were usually young men.  A naval officer would lead a '''press gang''' and force men onto warships where they were made to serve as sailors.  Their families (if they had families) seldom knew where they had been taken.

This was a normal practice in the Royal Navy during the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries.  Many people said that it should be stopped, but the Navy said it was a good way to get sailors who were needed to defend their country.  After the Napoleonic Wars the need for sailors was less and the Navy stopped impressing them.
