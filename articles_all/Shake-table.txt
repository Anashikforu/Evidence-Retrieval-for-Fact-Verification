'''Shake-table''' in earthquake engineering is a very effective experimental equipment to verify seismic performance associated with the direct damage to individual buildings or their building model|models under specified earthquake|ground shaking. The best way to do it is to put a building|structure on a shake-table that Earthquake performance simulation|simulates the earth shaking and to watch what may happen next (if you have no time to stand out in the field and wait for a real earthquake to strike). The earliest shake-table experiments were performed more than a century ago
