'''Beaumaris''' (, Literal translation: ''beautiful marsh'') is a small town on the island of Anglesey of the Menai Strait.

History
The town itself began  in 1295 when Edward I of England started to build Beaumaris Castle. This was one of several castle along  the North Wales coast  - others include Conwy Castle|Conwy, Caernarfon Castle|Caernarfon and Harlech Castle|Harlech . Many of the builders of the castle were from France.

The castle was built on a marsh by the village of Llanfaes. The French builders called the marsh ''beaux marais'' which means "beautiful marsh". This is how the town got its name.  The people who lived village in Llanfaes were removed  to a new village in the west of Anglesey to make way for the castle. This village was called Newborough and it still exists today.
