'''Tropical Storm Jerry''' was the tenth tropical cyclone|named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. It was a very short-lived storm over the north-central Atlantic Ocean. The storm lasted less than 48 hours, half of that time as a subtropical cyclone. It was never a threat to land.

Storm history


The system that would later become Tropical Storm Jerry started as a non-tropical low pressure area over the central Atlantic Ocean on September 21. The system moved in a shaky path over the north-central Atlantic over the next two days. It slowly developed deeper convection and became more organized. On September 22, the system had become organized enough that the National Hurricane Center mentioned a possible Tropical cyclogenesis|tropical or subtropical development in the area. Late that evening, it had been determined that a subtropical cyclone|subtropical depression had formed, as a warm core had developed but the system was still involved with an upper-level low and had its strongest winds well removed from the center.

Jerry began to weaken once again early on September 24 as it accelerated northeastward over cooler waters with sea surface temperatures below 24&nbsp;°C (75&nbsp;°F). It completely dissipated by early on September 25.

Impact
Jerry never came near land during its lifespan, and no damage or deaths were reported. No ships were impacted by Jerry.
