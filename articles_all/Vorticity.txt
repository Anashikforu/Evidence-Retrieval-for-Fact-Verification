'''Vorticity''' is a Mathematics|mathematical concept used in fluid dynamics. It can be related to the amount of "Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation" or "rotation" (or more strictly, the local angular rate of rotation) in a fluid.

The average vorticity in a small region of fluid flow is equal to the Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation \Gamma around the boundary of the small region, divided by the area A of the small region.

:\omega_{av} = \frac {\Gamma}{A}

Notionally, the vorticity at a point in a fluid is the Limit of a function|limit as the area of the small region of fluid approaches zero at the point:
: \omega = \frac {d \Gamma}{dA}

Mathematically, the vorticity at a point is a vector and is defined as the curl of the velocity:
:
\vec \omega = \vec \nabla \times \vec v .


One of the base assumptions of the potential flow assumption is that the vorticity \omega is zero almost everywhere, except in a boundary layer or a stream-surface immediately bounding a boundary layer.

Because a vortex is a region of concentrated vorticity, the non-zero vorticity in these specific regions can be modelled with vortices.
