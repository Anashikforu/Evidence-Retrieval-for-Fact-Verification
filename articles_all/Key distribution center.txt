In cryptography, a '''key distribution center''' ('''KDC''') is part of a cryptosystem intended to minimize the risks of exchanging key (cryptography)|keys and shared secrets.

KDCs often operate in systems when some users may have permission to use certain resources at some times but not at any times.

'''Benefits:''' Easier key distribution and scalability.
'''Drawbacks:''' A KDC can become a single point of failure and every user must trust the KDC administrators
