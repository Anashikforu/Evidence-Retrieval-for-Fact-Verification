'''Fabrosauridae''' is a proposed family of primitive ornithischian dinosaurs from late Triassic and Jurassic. The proposed "Fabrosaurs" descended from a ''Lesothosaurus''-like animal. The group is not established; it appears to be polyphyletic, and its members may come from several other better-known groups.
