The '''Multiple-purpose Vehicle''' or '''MPV''' is a purpose-built departmental derivative of a diesel multiple unit. Twenty-five two-car units were ordered by Railtrack to enable it to replace its motley collection of ageing departmental vehicles, many of which were converted from redundant passenger stock.
