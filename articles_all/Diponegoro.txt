'''Diponegoro''' was a Javanese prince who opposed the Netherlands|Dutch rule in Indonesia. He was the eldest son of Sultan 
Hamengkubowono III. Diponegoro was born at Yogyakarta in 1785 and died at Makassar in 1855.  During the Dutch rule, a ruler like his father had lost many rights such as the ability to lease land. Instead, he was paid by the Dutch to keep peace. This was an indignity to his father. This led to an open battle headed by Diponegoro himself using guerrilla tactics, which was called the Java War. It lasted for five years, from 1825 until 1830. During that period Diponegoro had successfully led battles, ambushing Dutch camps and raiding food supplies.
