'''''Stenonychosaurus''''' (meaning "narrow claw lizard") is a genus of troodontidae|troodontid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of Alberta, Canada based on a foot, fragments of a hand, and some caudal vertebrae.

A 2017 description had redeemed the validity of ''Stenonychosaurus'' and had informalised the genus '''"Troodon"''', synonymising it with ''Latenivenatrix''.
