The '''Moors''' were the Muslim inhabitants who lived on the Iberian Peninsula, Sicily, parts of Southern France, and North Africa in the Middle Ages. In Europe, the word is very often used to talk about people whose ancestors were North African.

The Moors (Umayyad Muslims) came from North Africa and Syria. Many of them came to what is now Spain and Portugal.  They had a very big influence on the culture of these countries.

Umayyad Muslims were the ones who captured Al Andalus and named it Al Andalus, Which means land of the vandals.
