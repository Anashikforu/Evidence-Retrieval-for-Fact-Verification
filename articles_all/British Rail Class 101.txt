The British Rail '''Class 101''' diesel multiple units were built by Metro-Cammell at Washwood Heath in Birmingham from 1956 to 1959, following construction of a series of British Rail Metro-Cammell|prototype units. This class proved to be the most successful and longest-lived of all BR's ''First Generation'' DMUs, with the final five units being withdrawn on 24 December 2003. The oldest set was, by then, just over 47 years old.
