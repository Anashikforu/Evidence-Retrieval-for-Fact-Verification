The first Person of the Year was aviator Charles Lindbergh, in 1927.  Since then, Persons of the Year have included groups, whole generations, important objects, and even the Earth.

The December 31, 1999 issue of ''Time'' named Albert Einstein the "Person of the Century". Franklin D. Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi were chosen as wikt:runner-up|runners-up.
