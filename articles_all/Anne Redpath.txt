'''Anne Redpath''' (1895 – 1965) was a Scotland|Scottish artist. She was born in Galashiels, Scotland.

She was the daughter of a tweed (cloth)|tweed designer. Her father's work had an effect on her use of colour and texture in her paintings. "I do with a spot of red or yellow in a harmony of grey, what my father did in his tweed", she said. She went to France during 1920 – 1933.
