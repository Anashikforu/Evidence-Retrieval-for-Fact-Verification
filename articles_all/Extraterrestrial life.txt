'''Extraterrestrial life''' is life that is not from the planet Earth. It is '''alien life'''. The word 'Earth|Terra' in Latin refers to our planet - Earth. Thus, Extraterrestrial Life refers to the Organism|life forms not originating on or from the planet Earth.

It is reasonable to say that planets rather like ours exist, and that life might evolve there also. So far none has been found, though it is possible that life once existed on Mars.Sagan, Carl & Shklovskii I.S. 1966. ''Intelligent life in the Universe''. Random House.

Searches have been made for signals from extraterrestrial life-forms.Sagan, Carl 1973. ''Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence''. MIT Press.  No signals have been received.

It is not a new idea. Quite a few philosophers have speculated on the existence of other planets like ours, with the idea that what happened here could also happen there.Crowe, Michael J. 1986. ''The Extraterrestrial life debate, 1750â€“1900. Cambridge.  One thing we do know is that many other star systems do have exoplanets.
