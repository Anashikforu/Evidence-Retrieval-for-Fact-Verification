The '''Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly''' was set up after the Belfast Agreement to allow the people of Northern Ireland to run their own government and pass some laws. The United Kingdom House of Commons of the United Kingdom|parliament can still abolish the assembly, because Northern Ireland is not an independent country, but a part of the United Kingdom. The assembly comes together in the city of Belfast. Speaker is Alex Maskey.

The assembly is elected using a form of proportional representation voting. The seats of each party after the 2017 election is shown in this table:
