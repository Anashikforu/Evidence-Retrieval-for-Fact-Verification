A '''California hurricane''' is a tropical cyclone that affects the state of California. Usually Pacific hurricanes weaken a lot before getting to land.
O
Normally, rainfall is the only effect that Pacific hurricanes have on California. Sometimes, this rainfall is strong enough to cause flooding and some damage. For example, floods from Hurricane Kathleen in 1976 created damages scattered across the southeastern California area and killed three people.

Why hurricanes do not normally hit California
The main reason why hurricanes do not hit California is because of cold sea surface temperatures off the California coastline and the California Current.

Tropical cyclones usually need sea surface temperatures above 26.5&nbsp;°C (80&nbsp;°F) with a depth of 50&nbsp;meters (160&nbsp;feet) to survive. But the waters off the California coast are too cold for tropical cyclones, even during the summer.
Also the California Current moves down from the northwestern US coast to the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, which is the opposite in which Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclones move. While a few tropical cyclones may hit the southern and central areas of the Baja California peninsula, they do not make landfall any farther north than that.

Preparations

Because of a possible threat of California hurricanes in the future and from the damaging effects of a 1858 tropical storm,
The most serious damage from a California hurricane would be from heavy rainfall rather than hurricane force-winds or a storm surge, although distant hurricanes may still create heavy surf, maybe hurting or killing people.
