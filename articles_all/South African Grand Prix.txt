The '''South African Grand Prix''' was first run as a Grand Prix Auto racing|motor racing handicap race in 1934 at the Prince George Circuit at East London, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. 

The races were stopped because of World War II. It was started again in 1962 as part of the Formula One circuit. It was a popular F1 event. It was stopped again after the 1985 race. Some nations began boycotting (not participating) South African events because of racial segregation policy of apartheid.AUTO RACING; 3 STAR Edition Compiled from wire reports by Ken Paskman.
