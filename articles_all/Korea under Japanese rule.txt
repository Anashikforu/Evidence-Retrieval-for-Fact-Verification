'''Korea under Japanese rule''' is a term to define Korea when it was under Japanese control. Japanese victory in the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895 and in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 cleared the way. Japan controlled Korea for 35 years during Japanese Empire|Japanese Imperialism. The Japanese control of Korea lasted from 22 August 1910  until 15 August 1945. The Japanese rulers of Korea left the country on 2 September 1945. In Japan, the more common term is "Korea of the Japanese-Governed Period" (日本統治時代の朝鮮, Nippon Tōchi-jidai no Chosen).

The period is usually divided into three parts. In 1910-1919, the Japanese treated Koreans very badly. From 1919 to 1930-s they created better policy|policies to deal with the Korean people. However, they later tried to force them to become Japanese.

Despite them being allies to the United States and having an interest in each other's cultures, Japanese and Koreans still tend to have suspicion of each other because of how Japan treated Korea during its time as a colony.
