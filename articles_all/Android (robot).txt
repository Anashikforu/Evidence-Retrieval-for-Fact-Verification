An '''android''' is a robot that looks very similar to Human|humans. In TV shows and movies, androids are usually represented by human actors without special effects, while robots are usually shown in clunky suits or in makeup.

In real life, androids do exist-- but they are inhuman and tend to look scary, falling into the uncanny valley.
