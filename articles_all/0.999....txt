'''0.999...''' (also written as 0., and read as "0 point 9 repeating") is one of the ways 1 (number)|the number 1 (one) can be written. Even though it is written like this, no matter how many 9 (number)|nines there are before the ellipsis, it is still equal in value to 1.

 About 
0.999... is a Rational number#Repeating Decimals|repeating decimal, which means the Numerical digit|digit "9" is repeated forever. It is different from 0.999, which only has three 9s.

0.999... can also be written as
0.\bar{9},
0.\dot{9} or
0.(9)\,.

It is hard for many people to understand why 0.999... is the same as 1. There are many mathematical proof|proofs that show why they are the same number, but many of these proofs are very complex.

 Examples 
One simple way of showing that 0.999... and 1 are the same thing is to Division (mathematics)|divide them both by the 3 (number)|number 3. When 0.999... is divided by 3, the answer is 0.333..., which is the same as  (the Fraction (mathematics)|fraction one third).

:{0.999\ldots \over 3} = 0.333\ldots = \frac 13

When 1 is divided by 3, the answer is  = 1, 0.999... must also equal 1. There are many other ways of showing this.

Another way of proving that 0.999... = 1 is by accepting the simple fact that if two numbers are different, there must be at least one number between them. For example, a number between 1 and 2 is 1.5, and a number between 0.9 and 1 is 0.95. Since 0.999... has an infinite number of 9s, there cannot be another number after the "last" 9, meaning there is no number between 0.999... and 1. Therefore, they are equal.

One more common proof is such:

x = 0.999...


10x = 9.999...

10x - 1x = 9x

9x = 9.999... - 0.999... = 9

x = 1

0.999... = 1

 In popular culture 
As the Internet developed, arguments about 0.999... are often on newsgroups and message boards. Even newsgroups and message boards that do not have much to do with math argue about this. In the newsgroup sci.math, arguing about 0.999... is a "popular sport". It is also one of the questions in its FAQ.As observed by Richman (p. 396).
