The '''Ainu language''' is the language of the Ainu people in northern Japan. It was not written until the 19th century. Since then, it has been written in katakana or the Latin alphabet.

In the 19th century, Ainu was spoken in Ezo (including Hokkaidō|Hokkaidō Island and the southern part of Chishima Islands), the southern part of Karapto (Sakhalin) and the northern part of Chishima Islands (Kuril Islands). Now it is only spoken in Hokkaidō.

Ainu had many dialects, including ''Chitose'', ''Saru'', and ''Karapto''.

Historically, speakers of Ainu lived near speakers of Japanese language|Japanese and Itelmen language|Itelmen (from Kamchatka). The Nivkh language|Nivkh, which was spoken in the northern part of Sakhalin, is another isolated language.
