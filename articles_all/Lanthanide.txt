A '''lanthanide''' is one of a group of 15 chemical element|elements that have atomic numbers 57 to 71. This is also known as the '''lanthanide series''' or '''lanthanoid series'''. This group starts at lanthanum and it ends at lutetium. 
Lanthanides are metals that are related to each other in how they behave. Most of them slowly turn into their hydroxides when they are placed into water, like the alkali metals. They usually form a coating of oxide when placed in the air, like most metals. Lanthanides, with Scandium and Yttrium, are called rare earth elements.
All the lanthanoids are silvery white soft metals and tarnish rapidly in air. The hardness increases with increasing atomic number.

Lanthanides are not abundant, and only small amounts are mined. Some have various uses in magnets, superconductors, chemical Catalysis|catalysts, and optical equipment such as lasers.
