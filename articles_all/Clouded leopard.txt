The '''clouded leopard''' (''Neofelis nebulosa'') is a rare cat species. It is a medium-sized felid, found from the Himalayan foothills through mainland Southeast Asia into China. It is 55 to 110&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;ft to 3&nbsp;ft 6 in) long and weighs between 15 and 23 kilograms|kg (33 to 50&nbsp;lb). It is classified as Vulnerable species|vulnerable in 2008 by IUCN. Database entry includes justification for why this species is vulnerable Its total population may be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals.Sanderson J. ''et al'' 2008. ''Neofelis nebulos''. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2012.2. International Union for Conservation of Nature. 
Clouded leopards hunt in trees as well as on the ground. Their prey are monkeys and birds. They are one of the few cats who are arboreal.

The genetic analysis of specimens of ''Neofelis nebulosa'' and its close relative ''Neofelis diardi'' suggests the two species diverged 1.4 million years ago. A group crossed a now submerged land bridge to Borneo and Sumatra from mainland Asia.Buckley-Beason, V.A. ''et al'' 2006. Molecular evidence for species-level distinctions in Clouded Leopards. ''Current Biology'' '''16''' (23): 2371â€“2376. 
The split between the two subspecies corresponds roughly with the catastrophic Volcanic eruption|eruption of the Toba supervolcano in Sumatra 69,000&ndash;77,000 years ago. A probable scenario is that Sunda clouded leopards from Borneo recolonized Sumatra during periods of low sea levels in the Pleistocene, and these were later separated from their source population by rising sea levels.Wilting A. ''et al'' 2010.
