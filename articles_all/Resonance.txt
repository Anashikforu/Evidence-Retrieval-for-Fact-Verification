In physics, '''resonance''' is the tendency of a system to vibration|vibrate with increasing amplitudes at some frequency|frequencies of excitation. These are known as the system's ''resonant frequencies'' (or ''resonance frequencies'').Tongue, Benson, ''Principles of Vibration'', Oxford University Pres, 2001,  The resonator may have a ''fundamental frequency'' and any number of ''harmonics''.

An example of useful effect of resonant frequency is a guitar string which makes a characteristic noise when it is touched. The noise depends on how thick or slack the string is.

Another example can be seen in a Swing (seat)|playground swing. There is one specific rate at which you must push away a person on a swing to cause the swing to go high. This rate is the resonant frequency.

In earthquake engineering, on contrary, any possibility of a resonance is detrimental for the building|building structure.

The Kirkwood gap and other connections among orbits are caused by orbital resonance.
