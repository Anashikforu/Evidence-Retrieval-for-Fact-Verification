'''Microsoft Bob''' is a computer program that was made by Microsoft. It was created to make Microsoft Windows easier to use. Microsoft Bob looks like a house that the user can move around in. The user's computer programs can be placed in the rooms to look like things in the house, like boxes and pictures.

History
Microsoft Bob was released in March 1995 (before Windows 95 was released), although it had been widely publicized prior to that date under the codename "Utopia".
