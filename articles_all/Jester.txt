 

A '''jester''', '''joker''', '''fool''', or '''buffoon''', is a type of entertainment|entertainer mostly (but not always) associated with the Middle Ages. Jesters typically wore brightly colored clothing. Their hats, sometimes called the ''cap â€™n bells'' or ''cockscomb'', were special; made of cloth, they were floppy with three points (liliripes) each of which had a jingle bell at the end. 

The three points of the hat represent the donkey|asses' ears and tail worn by jesters when they first appeared. Other typical things about the jester were his constant laughter and his mock scepter, known as a ''bauble'' or ''maharoof.''
