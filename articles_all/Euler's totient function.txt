In number theory, the '''totient''' of a positive number|positive integer ''n'' is the number of positive integers smaller than ''n'' which are coprime to ''n'' (they share no factors except 1). It is often written as \phi (n).

For example, \phi(8) = 4, because there are four numbers (1, 3, 5 and 7) which do not share any factors with 8.
The Function_(mathematics)|function \phi used here is the '''totient function''', usually called the '''Euler totient''' or '''Euler's totient''', after the Switzerland|Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who studied it.
The totient function is also called '''Euler's phi function''' or simply the '''phi function''', since the Greek letter Phi (letter)|Phi (\phi) is so commonly used for it. The '''cototient''' of ''n'' is defined as n - \phi(n).

The totient function is important mainly because it gives the size of the multiplicative Group_(mathematics)|group of integers modular arithmetic|modulo ''n''. More precisely, \phi(n) is the order of the group of unit (ring theory)|units of the Ring_theory|ring \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}. This fact, together with Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem, provides a proof for Euler's theorem. 

A common use of the totient function is in the RSA (algorithm)|RSA algorithm. The RSA algorithm is a popular method of encryption used worldwide.

For any prime number, ''p'', \phi(p) = p-1.
