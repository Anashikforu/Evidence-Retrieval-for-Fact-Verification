The group began in 1995 as a burlesque group based in Los Angeles, California.

By 2005 the group was lead singer Nicole Scherzinger, with Melody Thornton, Jessica Sutta, Ashley Roberts, Kimberly Wyatt and Carmit Bachar. The group also went into reality television programs, a Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas act, merchandising and other money making activities organized by Antin, Interscope, and their partners.

After Carmit Bachar left the group in March 2008, the group continued as a quintet. They made their second album in 2008, ''Doll Domination''. This album included the singles "When I Grow Up", "I Hate This Part" and "Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)". The group has been criticized for being too sexual in their image and dances.
