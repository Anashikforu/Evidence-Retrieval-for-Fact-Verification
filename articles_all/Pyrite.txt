 History 
Pyrite is the most common sulphide mineral. In ancient Roman times, the name was applied to several types of stone that would create sparks when it was struck against steel. Pliny the Elder described one of them as being brassy, which was almost certainly a reference to what is now called pyrite.James Dwight Dana, Edward Salisbury Dana, 
By Georgius Agricola's time, the term had become a generic term for all sulphide minerals.Herbert Clark Hoover and Lou Henry Hoover, translators of Georgius Agricola, De Re Metallica, The Mining Magazine, London (1912; Dover reprint, 1950); see footnote, p. 112.

Pyrite is usually found associated with other sulphides or oxides in quartz vein (geology)|veins, sedimentary rock, and metamorphic rock, as well as in coal beds and as a replacement mineral in fossils. Despite being nicknamed fool's gold, pyrite is sometimes found in association with small amounts of gold.
