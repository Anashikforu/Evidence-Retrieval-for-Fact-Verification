'''''Voyager 2''''' is a space probe used by NASA to explore Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter, Saturn (planet)|Saturn, Uranus (planet)|Uranus, and Neptune (planet)|Neptune.  It is the only spacecraft that has come near to Uranus and Neptune.  Because of this, a majority of pictures we see of these two ice planets came from this spacecraft.  It was identical in form to its sister spacecraft, ''Voyager 1''.  The probe is currently moving away from the solar system, and is heading out into interstellar space.

''Voyager 2'' was launched on August 20, 1977.

Both ''Voyager 1'' and ''Voyager 2'' include the Voyager Golden Record, which is a recording of sounds and images of life on Earth.  It was designed by a team headed by Carl Sagan to communicate with extraterrestrial life.

In 2018, NASA announced that Voyager 2 had reached the heliosphere|heliopause on 5 November of that year.
