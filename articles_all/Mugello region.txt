'''Mugello''' is a landscape in northern Italy. Mugello is north of Florence. The Santerno River's valley is nearby. The two valleys are separated by the Futa Pass (a path or way to cross over the mountain between those two valleys).

In ancient times it was on the border between the area settled by the Liguria|Ligurians (also called the Magelli tribe), the Etruscan civilization|Etruscans and the Gauls. The Roman Empire|Roman colonization left very few signs behind because the Mugello was mostly an agricultural area. In the Middle Ages it was home to many castles. Later on, Mugello was taken over by the Republic of Florence. Several families of the city built villas (large houses) there. They were similar to ones built by the house of Medici|Medici royal family.
