'''''Off the Wall''''' is an album by Michael Jackson. It was released in 1979. 5 of the 10 songs on the album were released as singles: "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough", "Rock With You", "Off the Wall", "She's Out of My Life", and "Girlfriend (Wings song)|Girlfriend". Three of them had videos. It sold over 8 million copies in the United States and 20 million copies around the world. The album got good reviews. ''Rolling Stone'' compared his vocals to the "breathless, dreamy stutter" of Stevie Wonder and described his tenor as "extraordinary beautiful".

The first single, "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough", reached No.1. It won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 1980. However, Jackson was disappointed at this. He said, "It was totally unfair that it didn't get Record of the Year and it can never happen again".

''Off the Wall'' was Jackson's first album produced by Quincy Jones.

In 2001 a special edition of the album was released by Sony Records with 9 extra tracks.

''Rolling Stone'' put the album at number 68 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2003.

In 2008 the album became part of the Grammy Hall of Fame.
