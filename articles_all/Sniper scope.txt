A '''sniper scope''' or '''telecopic sight''' is a kind of telescope that is attached to a rifle. These scopes can help a sniper aim and hit a target far away. Usually, they are made of metal, with glass on each end. They show markings to help aim. A rifle scope works by enlarging target area so you can aim more accurately. Scopes differ from iron sights, which are usually used in Crossbow|crossbows or some Machine gun|machine guns.

The scope hasn’t been around forever. In fact, scopes are relatively new inventions, dating back to the late 19th century. A book published in 1844 called ''the Improved American Rifle'' documents some of the first rifle markers manufactured in New York. The idea of using a telescope tube came in 10 years later. Willian Malcolm, a New York manufacturer, introduced optics to lenses.

It was during the World War when rifle scopes saw big improvements. With trench warfare came the rise of the snipers.

Back then, 6x magnification was considered a feat. But with today’s technology, we could use even 10x magnification scopes with rifles.
