History
'''Coldplay''', is an English alternative rock band, formed in London in 1996-1997. Chris Martin, and Jonny Buckland, were looking forward to form a band while at University College London.. ''Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star''. 2008-01-07. Retrieved 2008-05-05.

Coldplay's early material was compared to acts such as Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, U2, and Travis. They had achieved worldwide fame with the release of the single "Yellow (song)|Yellow" in 2000, followed by their debut album ''Parachutes (album)|Parachutes'' released in the same year, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The band's second album, ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' (2002), won multiple awards, including ''NME'''s Album of the Year. Their next release, ''X&Y (album)|X&Y'', received a slightly less enthusiastic yet still generally positive reception upon its release in 2005. The band's fourth studio album, ''Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends'' (2008), was produced by Brian Eno and released again to largely favourable reviews, earning several Grammy Award|Grammy nominations and wins.

= Formation and first years (1996–1999) =
Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland first met during their orientation week at University College London (UCL) in September 1996. The pair spent the rest of the college year planning a band, ultimately forming a group called Pectoralz. Guy Berryman, a classmate of Martin and Buckland, later joined the group. By 1997, the group, who had renamed themselves Starfish, performed gigs for local London Borough of Camden|Camden promoters at small clubs. Martin also had recruited his longtime school friend Phil Harvey, who was studying classics at University of Oxford|Oxford, to be the band's manager. Coldplay have since accepted Harvey as the fifth member of the group. The band's lineup was completed when Will Champion joined to take up percussion duties. Champion had grown up playing piano, guitar, bass, and tin whistle; he quickly learned the drums, despite having no previous experience. The band finally settled on the name "Coldplay" which was suggested by Tim Crompton, a local student who had been using the name for his group. By 1997, Martin had also met then Classics student Tim Rice-Oxley. During a weekend on Virginia Water, they asked each other to play off their own songs on the piano. Martin, finding Rice-Oxley to be talented, asked him to be Coldplay's keyboard player but Rice-Oxley refused as his own band, Keane, was already operational. Days after, this event would shape the second line-up of Keane and keep Coldplay's unaltered, thus leaving both bands as quartets.

In 1998, the band released 500 copies of the ''Safety (EP)|Safety EP.'' Most of the discs were given to record companies and friends; only 50 copies remained for sale to the public. In December of that year, Coldplay signed to the independent label Fierce Panda Records|Fierce Panda. Their first release was the three-track ''Brothers & Sisters (song)|Brothers & Sisters EP'', which they had quickly recorded over four days in February 1999.

After completing their final examinations, Coldplay signed to Parlophone for a five-album contract in the spring of 1999. After making their first appearance at Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury, the band went into studio to record a third EP titled ''The Blue Room (EP)|The Blue Room''. and the single "Bigger Stronger", received BBC Radio 1 airplay. The recording sessions for ''The Blue Room'' were tumultuous. Martin kicked Champion out of the band but later pleaded with him to return, and because of his guilt, went on a drinking binge. Eventually, the band worked out their differences and put in place a new set of rules to keep the group intact. Inspired by bands such as U2 and R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M., Coldplay decided that they would operate as democracy, and that profits would be shared equally. Additionally, the band determined they would fire anyone who used hard drugs.


= ''Parachutes'' (1999–2000) =
At first, the band planned to record their debut album in the space of two weeks. However, tours and other live performances caused the recording to spread out between September 1999 and April–May 2000.Roach, p. 45 In March 1999, Coldplay began work on their debut album, recorded at Rockfield Studios, Matrix Studios, and Wessex Sound Studios with producer Ken Nelson (British record producer)|Ken Nelson, although the majority of Parachutes' tracks were recorded at Liverpool's Parr Street Studios. The band worked in three studio rooms at Parr Street, and tracked much of the album in one of these rooms—the project studio which Nelson describes as "basically a Demo (music)|demo room". The album was mixed by American engineer Michael Brauer in New York. Coldplay's record label had originally intended to use a mixing engineer for the tracks they picked as singles, but eventually hired Brauer to work on all songs for the album.Sam Inglis (October 2000). 
After releasing three EPs without a hit song, Coldplay charted into the Top 40 with the lead single from ''Parachutes'', "Shiver (Coldplay song)|Shiver". Released in March 2000, it reached number 35 on the UK Singles Chart.. Retrieved 2008-09-07. The former was later released as a single in UK on 26 June 2000. In the United States, the song was released as the lead single off the then-untitled debut album. In October 2000, the track was sent to US college and alternative radio outlets.Basham, David (2000-10-16). 
Coldplay released their first studio album, ''Parachutes'', on 10 July 2000 in the United Kingdom by their record label, Parlophone Records|Parlophone. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. It was released on 7 November 2000 by record label Nettwerk in North America.

= ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' (2002–2004) =
After the success of ''Parachutes'', Coldplay returned to the studio in September 2001 to begin work on their second album ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'', once again with Ken Nelson producing. The band started recording the album in London a week after the September 11 attacks in the United States. Since the band had never stayed in London before, they had trouble focusing. They decided to relocate in Liverpool, where they recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Once there, vocalist Chris Martin said that they became obsessed with recording. "In My Place" was the first song recorded for the album. The band released it as the album's lead single because it was the track that made them want to record a second album following a "strange period of not really knowing what we were doing" three months after the success of Parachutes. According to Martin "one thing kept us going: recording 'In My Place'. Then other songs started coming."Cumberbatch, Franklin (2002-08-13). 
The band wrote more than 20 songs for the album. Some of their new material, including "In My Place" and "Animals", was played live while the band were still touring ''Parachutes''.Nelson, Chris (2001-02-12). 
Coldplay toured from June 2002 to September 2003 for the ''A Rush of Blood to the Head Tour''. They visited five continents, including co-headlining festival dates at Glastonbury Festival, V Festival|V2003 and Rock Werchter. Many concerts showcased elaborate lighting and individualised screens reminiscent of U2's ''Elevation Tour'' and Nine Inch Nails' ''Fragility Tour''.

In December 2003, readers of ''Rolling Stone'' chose Coldplay as the best artist and the best band of the year. At that time the band covered The Pretenders' 1983 song "2000 Miles" (which was made available for download on their official website). "2000 Miles" was the top selling UK download that year, with proceeds from the sales donated to Future Forests and Stop Handgun Violence campaigns. At the Grammy Awards of 2004|2004 Grammy Awards, Coldplay earned Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year for "Clocks".

 Musical style 
Coldplay's musical style has been defined as alternative rock, being compared to Radiohead and Oasis (band)|Oasis. The band's music has been called "meditative" and "blue romantic"; it "reflects on their emotions" and Martin "endlessly examines his feelings". Martin's lyrical wordplay has been called feminism|feminist, similar to Andrew Montgomery of Geneva (band)|Geneva.

The tone of the band's first studio album, ''Parachutes'', was described as melodic pop with "distorted guitar riffs and swishing percussion". It was also described as being "exquisitely dark and artistically abrasive".

In ''Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends'', the group's style was moving towards art rock, experimenting with different instruments such as tack pianos, and even what Will Champion described as a "very crude" variant of Spanish flamenco clapping.

Coldplay's musical style and image has also been satire|satirically described as "bland", with its members representing the "faces of radical beige" (a neutral color). University College London's satirical newspaper, ''The Cheese Grater'', featured a mock article in February 2010, following the arrest of UCL student Abdulmutallab on charges of terrorism, in which they declared that "Bland, middle class rock band was not monitored, admits University College. Were Coldplay made 'radically ...' at UCL?"Foley, Hugh (February 2010). "Bland, middle class rock band was not monitored, admits University College" in ''The Cheese Grater'' No. 24.

 Activism and commercial endorsements

Despite Coldplay's worldwide popularity, the band has remained protective of how their music is used in the media, refusing its use for some product endorsements. In the earlier years, Coldplay turned down multimillion-dollar contracts from Gatorade, Diet Coke, and Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap, who wanted to use the songs "Yellow (song)|Yellow", "Trouble (Coldplay song)|Trouble", and "Don't Panic (song)|Don't Panic" respectively. According to lead singer, Chris Martin, "We wouldn't be able to live with ourselves if we sold the songs' meanings like that." The band were also filmed for Make Poverty History, clicking their fingers.

During the early years, Coldplay became widely known in the media for giving 10 percent of the band's profits to charity,

In June 2009, Coldplay began supporting Meat Free Monday, a food campaign started by Paul McCartney which attempts to help slow climate change by having at least one meat free day a week.

From 17-31 December 2009, Coldplay auctioned a quantity of significant band memorabilia, including their first guitars. Proceeds went to Kids Company, a charity which helps vulnerable children and young people in London.
