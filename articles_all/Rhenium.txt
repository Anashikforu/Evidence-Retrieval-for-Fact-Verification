'''Rhenium''' is a chemical element.  It has the chemical symbol '''Re'''.  It has the atomic number 75.  It is a wikt:rare|rare metal.  It is silver white.  In chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements called the transition metals.  The chemistry of rhenium is similar to manganese. Discovered in 1908, rhenium was the second-last stable element to be discovered ('stable' meaning not radioactive). It was named after the river Rhine in Europe.

Nickel-based superalloys of rhenium are used in the combustion chambers, turbine blades, and exhaust nozzles of jet engines. These alloys contain up to 6% rhenium, making jet engine construction the largest single use for the element. The second-most important use is as a catalyst: rhenium is an excellent catalyst for hydrogenation and isomerization. 

Rhenium found as a by-product of molybdenum refinement. 

Rhenium is used in some manganese alloys.  Rhenium-molybdenum alloys are superconductors.

 History 
Rhenium was discovered by Walter Noddack, Ida Noddack, and Otto Berg in Germany. In 1925, they reported that they detected the element in a platinum ore and in the mineral columbite. They also found rhenium in gadolinite and molybdenite. In 1928, they were able to remove 1 g of the element from 660 kg of molybdenite.

 Characteristics 
Rhenium is a silvery-white metal. It has the third highest Melting point|melting points of all Chemical element|elements. It is also the third Density|densest element.

 Isotopes 
Rhenium has one stable isotope which is rhenium-185. Rhenium that is found in nature is made up of 37.4% rhenium-185 and 62.6% rhenium-187.

 Occurence 
Rhenium is one of the rarest elements in Earth's crust.

 Production 
Commercial rhenium is gotten from molybdenum roaster-flue gas. Some molybdenum Ore|ores contain 0.001% to 0.2% rhenium. Rhenium metal is made by Reduction (chemistry)|reducing ammonium perrhenate with hydrogen at high Temperature|temperatures.

 Uses 

Nickel-based Superalloy|superalloys of rhenium are used in the Combustion chamber|combustion chambers, turbine blades, and exhaust nozzles of Jet engine|jet engines. Rhenium is used in Superalloy|superalloys, such as CMSX-4 (2nd generation) and CMSX-10 (3rd generation). These superalloys are used in industrial gas turbine Engine|engines like the GE 7FA.
