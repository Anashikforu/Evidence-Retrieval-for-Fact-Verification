A '''manhole''' (also called a '''utility hole''', '''cable chamber''', '''maintenance hole''' ,  '''inspection chamber''',  '''access chamber''' or '''confined space''') is a hole for a person to go into to fix underground services. Some examples of these are sanitary sewer|sewers, telephone, electricity, storm drains and natural gas|gas.  

The opening is protected by a manhole cover. A manhole cover can also be called a "biscuit". It is designed to stop people falling down the hole and to stop people going underground if they are not allowed to. Manholes usually have metal or polypropylene steps on the wall to make it easier to get into the manhole.

Manholes are usually found in urban areas, in streets and sometimes under sidewalks. They are usually circular to stop the manhole cover from falling into the hole.

Hazards
In urban areas, electricity being in places it is not supposed to be (stray voltage) has become a big concern. In 2004, Jodie S. Lane was electrocution|electrocuted after stepping on a metal manhole cover. She was walking her dog in New York City when it happened.
