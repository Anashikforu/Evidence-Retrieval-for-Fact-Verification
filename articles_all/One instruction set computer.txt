A '''One Instruction Set Computer''' ('''OISC''') is an abstract computer that uses only one Instruction (computer science)|instruction (with no need for a machine language opcode). Such computers are the extreme case or the logical conclusion of Reduced instruction set computers, although the concept has been used only in academic Study circle|circles, as a teaching aid like the URISC.

The '''Ultimate RISC''' ('''URISC''') is the name given by researchers at the University of Waterloo in the city of Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, to their implementation of a single-instruction computer. URISC allows complete description of a fully functional computer, in only a few pages.
