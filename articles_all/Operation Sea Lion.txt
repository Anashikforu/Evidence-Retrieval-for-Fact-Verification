'''Operation Sea Lion''' () was the plan to invade the United Kingdom by Nazi Germany during World War II. The plan began in 1940. However, Germany first had to control the sky and sea of the English Channel before a land invasion. With the German Navy weakened during the German invasion of Norway and the Luftwaffe|German Air Force defeated in the Battle of Britain, the operation was put off on 17 September 1940 and so never happened.David Shears, "Hitlerâ€™s D-Day", ''MHQ'', vol. 6 Number 4 (Summer 1994)
