 Each member of the Lowell Observatory was allowed to vote on a short-list of three names. The names were Minerva (which was already the name for an asteroid), Cronus, and Pluto. Pluto received all votes.Croswell pp. 54â€“55 The name was announced on May 1, 1930. Upon the announcement, Madan gave Venetia five pounds as a reward.

The name became popular in culture. The Disney character, ''Pluto'', was introduced in the same year. He was named in the object's honor.

= IAU classification =
After a debate, in August 2006 an IAU resolution created an official definition for the term "planet". According to this resolution, there are three conditions for an object in the Solar System to be considered a planet:
# The object must be in orbit around the Sun.
# The object must be massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity. More specifically, its own gravity should pull it into a shape defined by hydrostatic equilibrium.
# It must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.

Pluto fails to meet the third condition. Its mass is much less than the combined mass of the other objects in its orbit: 0.07 times. Earth, by contrast, is 1.7 million times the remaining mass in its orbit (excluding the moon). The IAU also decided that bodies which, like Pluto, meet criteria 1 and 2 but do not meet criterion 3, would be called dwarf planets. 

In September 2006, the IAU included Pluto, and Eris and its moon Dysnomia (moon)|Dysnomia, in their Minor Planet Catalogue. it gave them the official minor planet designations "(134340) Pluto", "(136199) Eris", and "(136199) Eris I Dysnomia".

Pluto and its largest moon, Charon (moon)|Charon, are sometimes called a "binary system". This is because the barycentre of their orbits does not lie within them.
 The IAU has yet to formalise a definition for binary dwarf planets, and until it passes such a ruling, they classify Charon as a natural satellite|moon of Pluto.
