In cryptography, '''RC2''' is a symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric-key block cipher. Designed by Ron Rivest|Ronald Rivest in 1987. ''"RC"'' stands for "Rivest Cipher", or alternatively, "Ron's Code".

RC2 is a block size (cryptography)|64-bit block cipher with a variable key (cryptography)|key key size|size and using 18 rounds.

Rounds are arranged as a source-heavy Feistel cipher|feistel network, with 16 rounds of one type called ''"mixing rounds"'' Interleaving|interleaved by two rounds of another type called ''"mashing rounds"''.

The 18 rounds are performed using the following interleaved sequence: 
# perform 5 mixing rounds.
# perform 1 mashing round.
# perform 6 mixing rounds.
# perform 1 mashing round.
# perform 5 mixing rounds.

RC2 uses ''key-expansion algorithm'' by which an expanded key consisting of 64 (16-bit words) is produces depending in a complicated way on every bit of the supplied ''"variable-length"'' input key (cryptography)|key. A mixing round consists of four applications of the ''"mix-up"'' transformation, as shown in the diagram. A round is ''"mashed"'' by adding to it one of the 16-bit words of the expanded key (cryptography)|key (RFC 2268).

RC2 is susceptible to a related-key attack using 234 chosen-plaintext attacks (Kelsey ''et al.'', 1997).

The development of RC2 was sponsored by Lotus Software|Lotus, who were seeking a custom cipher be exported as part of their Lotus Notes software, after evaluation by the NSA. The NSA suggested a couple of changes, which Ron Rivest|Ronald Rivest incorporated. After further negotiations, the cipher was approved for export in 1989.

Along with RC4, RC2 with a 40-bit key size was treated under US Export of cryptography|export regulations for cryptography. Now all 40-bit encryption algorithms are obsolete because they are dangerously susceptible to brute force attacks.

Initially, the details of the algorithm were kept Trade secret|secret — proprietary to RSA Security — but on 29 January 1996, source code for RC2 was Anonymity|anonymously posted to the Internet on the Usenet forum, sci.crypt. A similar post had occurred earlier with RC4. It is unclear whether the poster had access to the specifications or whether it had been reverse engineering|reverse engineered.
