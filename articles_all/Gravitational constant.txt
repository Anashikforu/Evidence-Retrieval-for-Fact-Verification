The '''gravitational constant''', called G in physics equations, is an  empiricism|empirical physical constant. It is used to show the force between two objects caused by gravity. The gravitational constant appears in Isaac Newton's universal law of gravitation.

G is about  Nâ‹…m2/kg2, and is denoted by letter G.

It usually appears in Sir Isaac Newton's Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation, and in Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. It is also known as the '''universal gravitational constant''', '''Newton's constant''', and colloquially as '''Big G'''.
