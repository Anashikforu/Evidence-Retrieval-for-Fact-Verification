There are not a lot of wikt:crater|craters, but there are some cracks and lines. Because the surface is so young and smooth, scientists believe that there is a liquid ocean under the surface, and that it is kept warm by tidal heating.Greenberg, Richard; ''Europa: The Ocean Moon: Search for an Alien Biosphere'', Springer Praxis Books, 2005 In other words, Jupiter's strong gravity|gravitational pull on Europa makes it warm.
