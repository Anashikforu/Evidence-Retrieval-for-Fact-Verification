'''Numismatics''' is the study and collecting of coins and the history behind the coins. A '''Numismatist''' is either a collector of coins or a scholar who studies the history of coins.

Origin of Word
The term comes from a word meaning "of coins." The original word is French (numismatique), which itself is from a Latin origin (numismatis).Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus

History of Numismatics
Coin collectors may have existed in ancient times. Caesar Augustus may have been an example.Suetonius, ''Augustus'' 
Modern Numismatics
'''Modern numismatics''' is a sub-field that focuses on when coins started being stamped by machines (around 17th century on). Because of its focus, modern numismatics is more popular with collectors than with historians. Other subfields/variants include exonumia (focus on coin-like objects), notaphily (focus on paper money instead of coins), and scripophily (focus on stocks and bonds instead of coins).
