A '''pitcher plant''' is a carnivorous plant (also called as Insectivorous plant). Carnivorous plants are plants that eat insects and other small animals. Carnivorous plants grow in soil that has little nitrogen. All living things must have nitrogen. Carnivorous plants get nitrogen from the insects they eat.

The pitcher of the pitcher plant is actually a modified leaf. The apex of the leaf is the lid. Pitcher plants catch (get) insects in a cup of liquid. The walls of the cup make nectar (sweet liquid) . The nectar attracts insects. When an insect lands on the wall, it falls down into the liquid.Moran J.A. & Clarke C.M. 2010. The carnivorous syndrome in ''Nepenthes'' pitcher plants: current state of knowledge and potential future directions. ''Plant Signal Behavior'' '''5''' (6): 644–8. 
After the insect is dead, its body rots. Rotting releases (lets loose) the nitrogen from the insect's body. The nitrogen then goes into the liquid and the plant takes in the nitrogen from the liquid.Pritchard et al. 2002. Evolutionary adaptations in pitcher plants.'' International Journal of Evolutionary Biology''. '''12''' (3): 62–81.
