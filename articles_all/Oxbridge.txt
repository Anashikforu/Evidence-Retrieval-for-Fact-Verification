'''Oxbridge''' is a word that is used to mean the University of Oxford|University of '''Ox'''ford and the University of Cambridge|University of Cam'''bridge''' in England. It used to mean a fictional mix of the two universities, but now refers to both in real life.  

The word 'Oxbridge' started because the two universities are very similar:
 They are the two oldest universities in England; both were started more than 800 years ago.
 They were the only universities in England until the 19th century.
 Between them they have produced a large number of Britain's most well known scientists, writers, and politicians, Also, they both share a similar college system, as each university is made up of separate colleges.

The competition between Oxford and Cambridge also has a long history, dating back to the days when Cambridge was founded by unsatisfied scholars from Oxford.
