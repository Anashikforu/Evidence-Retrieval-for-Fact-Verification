A '''balcony''' is a kind of floor at a certain height, which stands out from the building. Usually, there is some kind of balustrade so people do not fall off.

There is a possibility to protect the balcony with a glazing. So called balcony glazings are important for certain areas that are heavily influenced by weather or noise. Assemblers, which create designs and static evaluation for the balcony glazing, are necessary to integrate the glazing conform with regulations and laws.

Unlike a terrace, balconies and also their balustrade need a Statics|static evaluation, so they don't take damage over time and can permanentely hold their visitors.
