This means, if you want to use a picture file in an article on Simple, you must upload it at ''':Commons:|Wikimedia Commons,''' instead of using this page.

"Commons" is the place that shares images with all the Wikimedia projects (Wikipedia, Wikibooks, Wiktionary, Wikisource, Wikiquote), in every language. Whenever a picture is placed on the Commons, it can be used here (and everywhere else, too) right away. Please read commons:Commons:First steps|Commons:First steps for more.
