An '''eyeborg''' or '''eye-borg''' is an electronic eye that allows people to hear colors. It is mostly used by blind people or by people with color blindness. It works by using a head mounted camera that reads the colors directly in front of a person, and converts them into musical notes.Alfredo M. Ronchi: ''Eculture: Cultural Content in the Digital Age.'' Springer (New York, 2009). p.319  

The first eyeborg was made in England in 2003 by Adam Montandon in collaboration with colourblind artist Neil Harbisson. The invention won a British award in Innovation (Submerge 2004)
