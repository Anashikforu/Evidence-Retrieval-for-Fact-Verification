Early history



When Dutch people first came to Manhattan, there were three small streams. They came together near what is now 10th Avenue and 40th Street. These three streams were part of a big stream called the "Great Kill" (Dutch: ''Grote Kill''). From there the Great Kill went through the low-lying Reed Valley, known for fish and other water animals.Gerard T. Koeppel, ''Water for Gotham: A History'', 2001:10. Its end was a deep bay in the Hudson River at present-day 42nd Street.Edric W. Sanderson, ''Mannahatta: A Natural History of New York City'', 2009: Appendix A p 253; refs. G.E. Hill and G.E. Waring Jr, "Old wells and water-courses on the isle of Manhattan", in ''Historic New York'', M.W. Goodwin, A.C. Royce, and R. Putnam, 1897; and others. People lived in a small area named Great Kill, where carriages were made. The higher land to the south and east was called Longacre.Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace, ''Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898'', 1999, p.721.

When the American Revolution was happening, John Morin Scott owned the land. Scott was in the army, which was led by George Washington. During the early 1800s, John Jacob Astor bought the land, then built houses and hotels for the rich on the land. By 1872, carriages were mainly made in Longacre. The city government named the area Longacre Square after Long Acre (street)|Long Acre, a place in London where carriages were also made.Kelly, Frank Bergen. 
In 1904, ''The New York Times|New York Times'' moved to a new building on 42nd Street at Longacre Square. Under there, a New York City Subway station was built. The area has been called "Times Square" since April 8, 1904. The square took its name from the newspaper. In 1913, the ''Times'' moved again. The old Times Building, One Times Square, is best known for the Times Square Ball drop that happens every December 31.
