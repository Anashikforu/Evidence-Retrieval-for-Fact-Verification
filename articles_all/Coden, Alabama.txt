'''Coden''' is a small fishing village near Bayou La Batre, Alabama|Bayou la Batre, Alabama, USA. It is about 20 miles southwest of Mobile, Alabama|Mobile, near the Alabama/Mississippi border. The name of the town comes from ''Coq d'Inde'', which is French for "Turkey".

Around 1900, the area was known as a resort, which is a place people go to on their vacations.  The Rolston Hotel brought visitors from all over the region. When it was destroyed by a hurricane, the community fell on hard times. The Rolston Hotel property now belongs to the City Of Bayou La Batre and is a park that  is  attracting people from other areas who want cool ocean breezes and peace that originally brought visitors. It is nice because it has the gentle sound of the water of Portersville Bay, fishing, and relaxation. Fresh seafood can be found on Shell Belt Road from fishing boats returning to Bayou Coden. Coden is on the southern shore of the mainland, across the Mississippi Sound from Dauphin Island and is one stop along Alabama's Coastal Birding Trail.
