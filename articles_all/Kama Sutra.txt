'''''Kamasutra''''' ( “The ''Kama Sutra'' is neither a sex-manual nor, as also commonly believed, a sacred or religious work. It is certainly not a Tantra|tantric text. In opening with a discussion of the three aims of ancient Hindu life – dharma, artha and kama – Vātsyāyana|Vatsyayana's purpose is to set kama, or enjoyment of the senses, in context. Thus dharma or virtuous living is the highest aim, artha, the amassing of wealth is next, and kama is the least of the three.” —Indra Sinha.
