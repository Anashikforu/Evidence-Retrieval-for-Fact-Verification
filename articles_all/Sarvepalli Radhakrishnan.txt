He was the bridge-builder between East and the West due to his great knowledge. He had the ability to simplify complex ideas.

Dr. Radhakrishnan was critical of the way teaching of Western Philosophers. The basis of criticism was that theology dominated the  western  thinkers preventing freedom of expression. He wrote books on Indian philosophy according to Western academic standards, and made all efforts for the West to give serious consideration to Indian philosophy. In his book, Idealist View of Life, he compares different ways of thought process and favours the simplistic rational way. He is well known for his analysis of ''Human Way of Life'' by listening from elders (Upanishads), use of common sense (Bramha Sutra) and practical way of living (Bhagvad Gita).His birthday is celebrated as Teachers Day all over India.
