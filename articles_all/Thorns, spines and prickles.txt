Botanists use three different words for sharp things on plants. They are '''thorns''', '''spines''', and '''prickles'''. '''Thorns''' are the ends of branches that are hard and sharp. '''Spines''' are hard structures with sharp ends. There are many different kinds of spines, some on leaf|leaves, some grow instead of leaves. '''Prickles''' are on the outside of stems. 

Spines, prickles, and thorns protect plants from plant-eating animals (defence against herbivory). Some plants and animals, such as the acacia|acacia tree and giraffe have evolution|evolved in response to each other. The plants grow very long spines and the animals develop very long tongues to reach past the spines and feed on the leaves.
