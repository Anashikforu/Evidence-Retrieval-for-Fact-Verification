The '''quadrature mirror filters''' (QMF) are two filters with frequency characteristics symmetric about 1/4 of sampling frequency (i.e. \pi/2). They are used especially in process of orthogonal discrete wavelet transform design.

 Simple variant 
In notation of Z-transform, we can create the quadrature mirror filter H_1(z) to (original) filter H_0(z) by substitution z with -z in the transfer function of H_0(z).
: H_1(z) = H_0(-z)\,

By doing it, the transfer characteristic of H_1(z) is shifted to H_0(z) by \pi.
: | H_1(e^{j\omega}) | = | H_0(e^{j(\pi-\omega)}) |\,

Impulse characteristic is therefore
: h_1n = (-1)^n h_0n\, for 0 \leq n , where N is filter length.

According to the picture above, the signal processing|signal split and passed into these filters can be downsampled by a factor of two. Nevertheless, original signal can be still reconstructed by using reconstruction filters G_0(z) and G_1(z). Reconstruction filters are given by time reversal analysis filters.
: G_0(z) = H_0(z^{-1})\,
: G_1(z) = H_1(z^{-1})\,

 Orthogonal filter banks 
For orthogonal discrete wavelet transform H_1(z) is given by
: H_1(z) = z^{-N} H_0(-z^{-1})\,, where N is filter length.

Impulse characteristic is
: h_1n = (-1)^n h_0N-1-n\, for 0 \leq n .

Reconstruction filters are still given by same equations.
: G_0(z) = H_0(z^{-1})\,
: G_1(z) = H_1(z^{-1})\,
