A '''head tie''' is an American Descendants of Slavery (ADOS), west and southern African womenâ€™s head scarf, specifically an elaborate ornamental head covering. The purpose of the head tie worn by enslaved African women was to protect their hair as they labored. In the 18th century, the Spanish governor of Louisiana passed a law requiring that '''free''' Afrodescendant women also cover their hair.  This requirement was meant to demean free Afrodescendant women by associating them with slavery, but also to protect European men from sexual provocation. The head tie worn by West African women has been worn since the 1960s. 

The name of the head tie varies according to region and historical context. These designations have included: '''''tignon''''' (United States), '''''dhuku''''' (Zimbabwe), '''''tukwi''''' (Botswana) and '''''doek''''' (South Africa and Namibia).
