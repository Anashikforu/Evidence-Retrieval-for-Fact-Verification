"Anarchy in the U.K." was covered by American heavy metal music|heavy metal band Megadeth for their third album ''So Far, So Good... So What!'', released in 1994.

Megadeth's version has altered lyrics. Dave Mustaine explained that he could not understand Johnny Rotten's singing, so he made up the parts he could not understand (in a notable example, the line "another council tenancy" is changed to "and other cunt-like tendencies"). In addition, the country is changed to "USA", though the title is kept unchanged. The song's music video is a montage of live footage of the band, cartoon political figures, which were designed and caricatured by Genndy Tartakovsky, Craig McCracken, Paul Rudish and Rob Renzetti and animated by Fil-Cartoons, various stock footages, and of a man being forced to watch (much like Alex's therapy in ''A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange''). Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones played the second solo.

Mustaine now refuses to play the song live due to lyrics referring to the Anti-Christ, and he believes he's "better for it".
