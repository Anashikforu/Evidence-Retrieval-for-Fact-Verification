In mathematics, '''arithmetic''' is the basic study of numbers. The four basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and Division (mathematics)|division, although other operations such as exponentiation and extraction of Nth root|roots are also studied in arithmetic.

Other arithmetic topics includes working with signed numbers, Fraction (mathematics)|fractions,  decimals and Percentage|percentages.

Most people learn arithmetic in primary school, but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned. Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic, and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic. A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include carpenters, plumbers, automobile mechanic|auto mechanics, accountants, architects, Medical doctor|doctors, and nurses. Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics, science, and engineering.

Some arithmetic can be carried out mentally. A calculator can also be used to perform arithmetic. Computers can do it more quickly, which is one reason Global Positioning System receivers have a small computer inside.

 Examples of arithmetic 
 2 + 3 = 5 (adding is commutative property|commutative: 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2)
 7 − 5 = 2 (subtracting is not commutative: 7 − 5 is different from 5 − 7)
 3 × 4 = 12 (multiplying is commutative: 3 × 4 is the same as 4 × 3)
 6 ÷ 2 = 3 (dividing is not commutative: 6 ÷ 2 is different from 2 ÷ 6
