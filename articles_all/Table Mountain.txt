 Geology 
The upper part of the mountain ''mesa'' (table) consists Silurian/Ordovician quartzitic sandstone, commonly referred to as Table Mountain Sandstone (TMS). It is highly resistant to weathering and forms steep grey crags. 

Below the sandstone is a layer of micaceous shale, which weathers quite readily. The Basement (geology)|basement of folded Metamorphic rock|metamorphic shales intruded by the Cape Granite are of late Precambrian age.
