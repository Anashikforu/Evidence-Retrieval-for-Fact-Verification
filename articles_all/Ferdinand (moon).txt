'''Ferdinand''' is the farthest Prograde and retrograde motion|retrograde non-Sphere|spherical moon of Uranus (planet)|Uranus. It was found by Matthew J. Holman, John J. Kavelaars, Dan Milisavljevic, and Brett J. Gladman on August 13, 2001 and given the designation '''S/2001 U 2'''.

Designated '''Uranus XXIV''' it was named after the son of the King of Naples in William Shakespeare's play ''The Tempest''.

Ferdinand is the farthest known moon of Uranus. It follows a retrograde, fairly inclination|inclined but very eccentricity|eccentric orbit.
The diagram illustrates the orbital parameters of the retrograde non-spherical moons of Uranus (in polar co-ordinates) with the eccentricity of the orbits represented by the segments extending from the apsis|pericentre to the apsis|apocentre.
