'''Transnistria''', '''Transdniestria''', or '''Pridnestrovie''', officially the '''Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic''' ('''PMR'''; ), is a List of states with limited recognition|partially-recognized state in Eastern Europe. 

The country is recognized by three other partially or unrecognized states, Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Nargorno-Karabakh Republic, and South Ossetia. The country declared independence from Moldova on 2 September 1990. With the help of the Russian army, it defeated the Moldovan army in the War of Transnistria. 

There has been peace since 1992, but the Council of Europe calls Transnistria a "frozen conflict" region.

There is argument about whether it is really a country or not. The region continues to boast independence, and acts independently over its territory with the help of peacekeeping forces from foreign countries.

In a vote in 17 September 2006, 97% voted to be free from Moldova. This vote has not been accepted by Moldova, which calls the territory the "Territory of the Left Bank of the Dniester".

Transnistria is the only independent state to still use the hammer and sickle on its flag.
