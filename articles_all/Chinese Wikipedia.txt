 Basic information 

= Name origin =

In the English language, "Wikipedia" is a portmanteau word made by "Wiki" (A technology that allows many people working together) and "encyclopedia". At first, "Wikipedia" did not have a Chinese name. The site was called "Zhongwen Wikipedia" (中文Wikipedia, Chinese Wikipedia). On October 21, 2003, Wikipedia's Chinese name "Weiji Baike" (维基百科/維基百科, meaning Weiji Encyclopedia) was decided by the Chinese wiki community (13 people voted). The pronunciation of "Weiji" is like the pronunciation of "Wiki". "Wei" (wikt:维|维/維) means rope that can link things, or net. "Ji" (wikt:基|基) means basic, or base. So "Weiji Baike" means "the encyclopedia on the Internet that covers human's all basic knowledge".
