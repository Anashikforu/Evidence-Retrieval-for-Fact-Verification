'''Baldwin County''' is a county in the U.S. state of Alabama.

It is named in honor of Abraham Baldwin, a member of the United States Senate from Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia who never actually lived in Alabama. In 2000 the population was 140,415.
 History 
Baldwin County was made on December 21, 1809 ten years before Alabama became a state. Before this, the county had been a part of the Mississippi Territory until 1817 when the area passed into the Alabama territory

The borders of the county has often changed, and many armies have invaded.

In the first days of Baldwin County, the town of McIntosh Bluff (now in Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile County) on the Tombigbee River was the county seat. Then the county seat moved to the town of Blakeley, Alabama|Blakeley in 1810, and then to the City of Daphne, Alabama|Daphne in 1868. In 1900, by an Act of the Legislature of Alabama said that the county seat should move to the City of Bay Minette, Alabama|Bay Minette. The City of Daphne was not happy about this move, because being the county seat meant more people visit the city and businesses can sell more. To move the county seat to Bay Minette, some men from Bay Minette pretended that there had been a murder. When the sheriff and his deputy left the City of Daphne to look for the murderer the men from Bay Minette went to the City of Daphne. These men got the records from the Baldwin County Courthouse and took them back to the City of Bay Minette. A New Deal mural in the Bay Minette post office is a painting of this story.

Baldwin County is close to the Gulf of Mexico. This is why it often has tropical weather systems which often are Hurricanes. Weather dameage can sometimes be very bad, and sometimes the county is made a ''disaster area''. For example, in September 1979 due to damage from Hurricane Frederic,
