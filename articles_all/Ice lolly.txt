An '''ice lolly''', '''ice lollipop''', or '''ice pop''', is a Freezing|frozen snack of flavoured ice. It is made by freezing flavoured liquid (such as fruit juice) or cream around a wooden stick. Once the liquid freezes solid, the stick can be used as a handle to hold the ice pop. In the United States, the snack is also referred to as a '''popsicle''' after the brand.

In the city of Liverpool, UK, they use the actual term Lolly Ice as it is a Lolly made of ice, not Ice made of Lolly.
