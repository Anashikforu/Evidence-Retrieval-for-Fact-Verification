This is a '''list of Germanic deities''' that are in Norse mythology.
Divided between the ''Æsir'' and the ''Vanir'', and sometimes including the ''jotun|jötnar'' (giants), the dividing line between these groups is less than clear. However, it is usually accepted that the Æsir (including Óðinn, Þór and Týr) were warrior gods, while the Vanir (mainly Njörður, Freyja and Freyr) were fertility gods. Various other groups of beings, including Álfar|elves, Norse Dwarves|dwarves and jötnar were probably minor gods, and might have had small cults and sacred places devoted to them.
