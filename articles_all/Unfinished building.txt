An '''unfinished building''' is a building that was being built, but was either wikt:abandoned|abandoned or is on hold. There are many different reasons why buildings have not been completed. One of the biggest reasons for unfinished buildings, is when the money runs out. The National Monument in Scotland was planned to be a War Memorial for soldiers killed in the Napoleonic Wars. Building started in 1826, but the money ran out in 1829. The Sagrada Família, a church in Barcelona, Spain, was started in 1882 and is still not finished. It is not finished because when the architect, Antoni Gaudí, died in 1926 after he was hit by a tram, and he did not leave many plans for the building. What was left was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War. The war also meant that there was not enough money to complete the project.
