The '''Alveolata''' is a grouping of protists. One view is that it is a superphylum with at least four phyla. 

 Phyla 



 Ciliates, very common protozoa, with many short cilia arranged in rows
 Chromerida â€“ a marine phylum of photosynthetic protozoa
 Apicomplexa, parasitic protozoa that lack locomotive structures except in gametes
 Dinoflagellate, mostly Marine biology|marine flagellates, many of which have chloroplasts
