'''Glinde''' is a town in the province of Schleswig-Holstein in Germany, about 20 km away from Hamburg.

 History 
The name Glinde is found in a document from March 25 1229 for the first time. In the document, Earl Adolf IV. of Schauenburg and Holstein gave the village to a Cistercian convent. (The convent moved to today's town of Reinbek.) The King of Denmark and Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, Frederick I of Denmark, got all the convent had during the Protestant Reformation. In 1544 his son Christian III of Denmark|Christian III gave a part of it to each of his brothers. The owner changed again several times.

In 1948, the town administration of Glinde, Oststeinbek, Havighorst and Schönningstedt were brought together to the Amt (country subdivision)|Amt Glinde. Schönningstedt left that combination in 1949 and Havighorst left it in 1973. So Glinde und Oststeinbek became independent villages.

On June 24, 1979, (on the 750th anniversary of the village), Glinde became a town.
