The standard shape for pyrohy is oblong with tapering ends, but rectangle|rectangular or circle|circular pyrohy are also common. They can be closed or open-faced with no wikt:crust|crust on top (like a tart).

 Filling 
The filling for pyrohy may be sweet and contain cottage cheese, or fruits like apple, plums or various berry|berries.

In Ukrainian and Russian cuisines, pyrohy with a savory filling are traditionally served (like pirozhki) together with borscht, or soup.
