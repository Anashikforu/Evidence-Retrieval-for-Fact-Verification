'''Leonard James''' "'''Jim'''" '''Callaghan, Baron Callaghan of Cardiff''', 

Born in the 1910s, Callaghan was an old-style socialist, lacking any higher education, and served as Member of Parliament (MP) for a Cardiff constituency. He is the only person to have held all three leading Cabinet of the United Kingdom|UK Cabinet positions (Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary), prior to their premiership. He was never expected to reach the premiership, having taken a back seat to the younger and more charismatic Harold Wilson for many years. However, when Wilson unexpectedly announced his retirement in 1976, Callaghan was the most experienced candidate to replace him. His time as prime minister was one of more open government but the electorate was dissatisfied with his relaxed response to high inflation and more Labor unrest|industrial unrest, and replaced Labour with a Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher.

Callaghan resigned as Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party shortly afterwards, but remained an MP for some years before being sent to the House of Lords as Baron Callaghan of Cardiff.
