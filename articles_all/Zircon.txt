'''Zircon''' is a silicate mineral. It is found in many different places in almost all kinds of rock. The chemical it is made up of is called  ''zirconium silicate'':  ZrSiO4. Clear zircon may look like diamond and has been used as a cheaper replacement for diamond.  It is not the same as cubic zirconia, which is man-made zirconium dioxide.  In the United States, zircon is considered to be the birth stone for the month of December.

 Long lasting zircons 
Zircons from the Jack Hills in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, have yielded U–Pb (Uranium-lead dating|uranium–lead radioactive dating) ages up to 4.404 billion years.
