'''''Hydra (animal)''''' are simple invertebrates, with two layers of body cells. They live in fresh water. Their body is radially symmetry|symmetric. They have a central cavity through which they take in food and expel waste. 

As Cnidaria they have cnida|stinging cells on their tentacles. They are hydrozoa, and belong to the same order as other polyps. Most ''Hydra'' are microscope|microscopic in size. Hydras can be found in almost any unpolluted body of water. Hydras reproduce by budding. In budding, the offspring forms as a lump on the parent and eventually becomes big enough to break off and live by itself. They can move if they need to by a kind of slow somersaulting motion. 

Recent research has found they produce an antimicrobe|microbial protein ''hydramacin'', which protects their outer layer from bacterial infection.Jung S. ''et al'' 2009.
