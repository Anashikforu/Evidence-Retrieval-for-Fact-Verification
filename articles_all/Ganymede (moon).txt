'''Ganymede'''#Notes|p  is the largest of over 66 Satellite (natural)|moons of the Jupiter (planet)|planet Jupiter. It is also the largest moon in the Solar System. Ganymede is larger in diameter than the Mercury (planet)|planet Mercury, but has only about half of its mass. Ganymede is much less density|dense. Ganymede is part of a group called the Galilean Satellites. These also include Io (moon)|Io, Europa (moon)|Europa and Callisto (moon)|Callisto.

Galileo Galilei discovered this moon in 1610.Galilei, G.; 
 Structure 
Ganymede is composed of roughly equal amounts of silicate|silicate rock and water ice. Its surface has dark regions, with impact craters dated to four billion years ago. This covers about a third of the satellite. Lighter regions, crosscut by grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient, cover the rest. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of tectonics|tectonic activity caused by tidal heating.Tidal heating: the huge force of Jupiter's gravitation deforms the satellite as it swings round its orbit. The orbit is not circular, and this sets up the stresses which cause the tectonic activity.

 Notes 
:p #top|^ The name "Ganymede" is said as /''Gan-ee-Meed''/.
