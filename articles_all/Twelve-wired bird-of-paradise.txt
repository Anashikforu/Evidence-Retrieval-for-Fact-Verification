The '''twelve-wired bird-of-paradise''' (''Seleucidis melanoleucus'') is a medium-sized bird-of-paradise about 33cm-long. The male has a red Iris (anatomy)|iris, black shoulders and  wings, a long black Beak|bill and rich yellow Feather|plumes along its sides and stomach.  From the rear of these plumes come twelve blackish, wire-like filaments, which bend back near their bases to sweep forward over the birds hindquarters.  

The female is a brown bird with black-barred buffy underparts. Its feet are strong, large-clawed and pink in color.

It is the only species in the monotypic genus ''Seleucidis''. The male displays on an exposed vertical perch with its breast-shield flared. They eat fruits and arthropods.

The bird is found in lowland forests, New Guinea and Salawati Island of Irian Jaya.
