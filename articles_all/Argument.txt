A '''argument''' is a way to persuade someone of something. Reasons are given to accept the conclusion.
Reason
An argument is a wikt:reason|reason to support an opinion. 

There can be a "strong argument" or a "convincing argument" (for example, a good reason for why something should be done). '''Arguing''' is the process of conducting an argument.

The opposite is a "weak argument" or an "unconvincing argument". Arguments can be wikt:valid|valid or wikt:invalid|invalid or a wikt:combination|combination of both.  Some arguments may appear reasonable, but they turn out to be misleading or wrong.Blakesley, David and Jeffrey L. Hoogeveen. (2007).
