'''Lithium carbonate''' is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Li2CO3. It contains lithium and carbonate ions.

Properties
Lithium carbonate is a white solid. It dissolves in water, although not as much as sodium carbonate. It reacts with acids to make carbon dioxide. It can react with carbon dioxide temporarily to make the bicarbonate. lithium carbonate is basic in nature.

Preparation
It can be made by mixing lithium oxide or lithium hydroxide and carbon dioxide.

 Production 
Lithium is Extraction (chemistry)|extracted from two main sources: pegmatite Crystal|crystals and lithium compounds from Brine pool|brine pools. It is also found in the rare mineral zabuyelite.

Uses
Lithium carbonate is used in various medications for treating bipolar disorder. It is also used in fireworks to make a bright red color. It is used in processing metal oxides. It can be used to make glass. It is used to glaze ceramics. It can also be used to dry cement. It is used in making lithium-ion battery|lithium ion batteries. It is used in carbon dioxide detectors.Safety
Lithium carbonate is somewhat toxic. It is a base (chemistry)|base, and reacts with strong acids.
