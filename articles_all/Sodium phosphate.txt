'''Sodium phosphate''' is a group of chemical compounds. The phosphate atom can hold three other atoms. They can be three hydrogen (phosphoric acid), two hydrogen and one sodium(sodium dihydrogen phosphate), one hydrogen and two sodium (disodium hydrogen phosphate), or three sodium (trisodium phosphate).

Sodium dihydrogen phosphate
'''Sodium dihydrogen phosphate''', also known as '''monosodium phosphate''', is a chemical compound with the formula NaH2PO4. It is acidic. It is used in some baking powders. It is used as a laxative or a pH buffer (something that keeps a chemical from getting more acidic or basic). It is made by reaction of a little sodium hydroxide with phosphoric acid.

Disodium hydrogen phosphate
'''Disodium hydrogen phosphate''', also known as '''disodium phosphate''' is a chemical compound with the formula Na2HPO4. It is about neutral (not acidic or basic). It is used to prevent clumping in foods. It is made by reaction of some sodium hydroxide with phosphorus.

Trisodium phosphate

'''Trisodium phosphate''', also known as '''sodium phosphate''', is a chemical compound with the formula Na3PO4. It is base (chemistry)|basic. It formerly was used in detergents, but the phosphate fueled algal blooms. It is made by combining sodium hydroxide and phosphoric acid.
