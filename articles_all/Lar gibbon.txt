The '''lar gibbon''' (''Hylobates lar'') is also known as the '''white-handed gibbon'''. It is a primate in the Hylobatidae or gibbon family. It is one of the better-known gibbons. It is often seen in zoos.

The fur coloring of the lar gibbon is not fixed. It can range from black and dark-brown to light brown sandy colors.

 
Lar gibbons are diurnal (they are active during the day).  They are arboreal, living in rainforests. Family groups live in a firm territory. They protect it from other gibbons by their calls.
