'''Pythagoreanism''' is a term used for the esoteric and metaphysics|metaphysical beliefs held by Pythagoras and his followers, the Pythagoreans, who were much influenced by mathematics. They thought the world was made of numbers, and that various integers had distinct sacred meanings.

Later resurgence of ideas similar to those held by the early Pythagoreans are collected under the term Neopythagoreanism.
