'''Homeopathy''' is an alternative medicine.
Creation
Homeopaths make their medicines by taking the ingredients, adding water, and shaking the mixture. They then take a drop of the mixture, throw out the rest, and add more water. They do this usually 30 times but sometimes up to 200 times. They call it potentisation. Hahnemann said this would bring out the "spirit-like medicinal powers held within a drug".Disputes
Homeopathy became popular because it was created at a time when medicine did not work very well and could make people sick.
