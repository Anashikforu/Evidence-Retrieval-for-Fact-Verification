 Economic impact 
From 1945 to 1964 about seventy-seven million babies were born in the United States.

By the 1960s many baby boomers were teenagers. They spent nearly $20 million on things including food, clothing, and recorded music. Businesses were eager to find ways to meet their demands. By the 1970s entire industries were changing because of baby boomers.

 Aging and end-of-life issues 
In 1998 the baby boomers began to discuss about their end-of-life issues; but many commentators think they have became burdens for their children and society. According to the 2011 Associated Press and LifeGoesStrong.com surveys:

60% lost value in investments because of the economic crisis
42% are delaying retirement
25% claim they will never retire (currently still working) 
 Baby boomer today 
The oldest baby boomers were 67 years old in 2013 and one in five Americans will be 65 years old in 2030. Many people believe they will become a stress on social welfare systems.
