'''''Me, Myself and I''''' is an rhythm and blues|R&B/neo soul song written by Beyoncé Knowles, Scott Storch, and Robert Waller for Knowles' solo debut studio album ''Dangerously in Love'' (2003). In this laid-back, but strong-willed female-empowerment anthem, the song's protagonist comes to terms with a cheating boyfriend, and declares that in the world that there is only one person she can trust who never lets her down: herself. "Me, Myself and I" was the third single to be released from the album, in the last quarter of 2003. It reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100 for two weeks, becoming Beyoncé's fourth consecutive top five single in the United States; it also reached eleven in the United Kingdom.
