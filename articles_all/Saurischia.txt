'''Saurischia''' is one of the two Order (biology)|orders of dinosaurs. In 1888, Harry Seeley Scientific classification|classified dinosaurs into two main orders.Seeley, H.G. (1888). "On the classification of the fossil animals commonly named Dinosauria." ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', '''43''': 165-171. Their hip structure was why they were put into these orders. Saurischians ('lizard-hipped') and the Ornithischia|ornithischians ('bird-hipped') have differences in the ways bones in the hip are put together.

All carnivore|carnivorous dinosaurs (the Theropoda|theropods) are saurischians, and so are the sauropods like ''Diplodocus'' and ''Brachiosaurus''.

Birds are direct descendants of a group of theropod dinosaurs, so they are a sub-clade of saurischian dinosaurs in modern classification.
