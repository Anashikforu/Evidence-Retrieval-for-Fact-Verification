'''Umbriel''' is a moon of Uranus (planet)|Uranus found on October 24, 1851 by William Lassell. It was found at the same time as Ariel (moon)|Ariel.

 Name 
The name "Umbriel" and the names of all four moons of Uranus then known were suggested by John Herschel in 1852 at the request of Lassell. 
It is also designated '''Uranus&nbsp;II'''.

 Physical characteristics 
So far the only close-up images of Umbriel are from the ''Voyager 2'' probe, which made observations of the moon during its Uranus flyby in January, 1986. During the flyby the southern hemisphere of the moon was pointed towards the Sun so only it was studied.

Umbriel's surface is the darkest of the Uranian moons, and reflects only about half as much light as Ariel (moon)|Ariel, Uranus' brightest moon. It has far more and bigger craters than do Ariel (moon)|Ariel and Titania (moon)|Titania and is also the least geologically active.

= Craters =
Craters on Umbriel are named after many different demons from various mythologies.
