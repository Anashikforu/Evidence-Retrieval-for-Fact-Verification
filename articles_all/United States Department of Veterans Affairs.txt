 History 
The beginning of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs dates back to 1636 when the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony voted that the Colony would support soldiers disabled by its war with the Native American tribe called the Pequot. During the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress of 1776 enacted pensions for disabled soldiers. Then, in the 19th century, support was extended to widows and dependents of veterans. Veterans' benefits expanded further during World War I, with the first consolidation of World War I veterans' programs occurring in 1921 when Congress created the Veterans Bureau. With increased benefits and agencies disbursing the benefits, the Veterans Administration was established in 1930, bringing all the agencies together. Frank T. Hines was the first administrator of veterans affairs, leading the organisation until 1945. The GI Bill was passed in 1944 as the first educational assistance to military personnel.

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs was officially established as a Cabinet-level department on March 15, 1989, by President George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush.
