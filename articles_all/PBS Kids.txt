'''PBS Kids''' is the educational children's television programme|programming brand of the PBS|Public Broadcasting Service. It started in 1994. Its programming is advertisement|non-commercial, like all PBS programming. PBS Kids programs are mostly shown in the daytime. These programs are meant for children ages 3-10 (with some exceptions, Barney and Friends is 2-7, Sesame Street is 2-7, Arthur is 4-9, etc.). PBS Kids's programs use science, math and reading. Some of them also include social studies. All of the programs give a problem that the children have to solve.
