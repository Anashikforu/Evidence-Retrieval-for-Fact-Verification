'''Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin''' (7 June 1848 – 8 May 1903) was a leading France|French Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist Painting|painter. He was not well appreciated until after his death. Gauguin was later recognized for his experimental use of color and style that were different from Impressionism. His work was influential among the French avant-garde and fauvism, as well later artists such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. Gauguin’s art became popular after his death; partly from the efforts of art dealer Ambroise Vollard.
Gaugin gave up his family and life to live in Tahiti in 1891. He died of syphilis in 1903.
