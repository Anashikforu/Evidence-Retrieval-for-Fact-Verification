'''''No Protection''''' is the name of a Dub music|dub remix of Massive Attack's second album ''Protection (album)|Protection''.  The remix was done by the British Dub music|dub producer Mad Professor.  Mad Professor was contacted by Massive Attack after ''Protection'' was released to remix a song for a single.  After the single was remixed, the band asked Mad Professor to listen to more of the album to find the possibility of more remixes.  The project then became a track by track remix of almost the entire album. Mad Professor heavily edited the original material to form a slow, pulsating mix in which the beat is emphasized, reverb is extensively used and the occasional vocals (many of the tracks are almost entirely instrumental) fade in-and-out in normal dub fashion, making a hypnotic, if hi
