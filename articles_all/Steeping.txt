'''Steeping''' may mean:
#Soaking in liquid until saturation|saturated with a solution|soluble .
#Soaking to remove an ingredient; Example: salt from smoked ham or salted cod.

One example is the steeping of maize|corn, part of the mill (grinding)|milling process. As described by the US Corn Refiners Association, harvested kernels of corn are cleaned and then steeped in water at a temperature of 50 degrees for 30 to 40 hours. In the process their moisture content rises from 15% to 45% and their volume more than doubles. The gluten bonds in the corn are weakened and starch is released. 

The corn is then ground to break free the Pathogen|germ and other components, and the water used (steepwater), which has absorbed various nutrients, is recycled for use in animal feeds.
