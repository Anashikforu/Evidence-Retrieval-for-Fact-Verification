The '''Belgian Grand Prix''' is an Auto racing|motor race, part of the Formula One World Championship.
The first national race of Belgium was held in 1925 at the Spa, Belgium|Spa region's race course, an area of the country that had been associated with motor sport since the very early years of racing before the turn of the century. To accommodate Grand Prix racing, the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps race course was built in 1921 but it was only used for motorcycle racing until 1924. After the 1923 success of the new 24 hours of Le Mans in France, the Spa 24 Hours, a similar 24 hour endurance race, was run at the Spa track.
