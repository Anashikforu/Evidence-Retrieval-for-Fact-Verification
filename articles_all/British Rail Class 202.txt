The British Rail '''Class 202''' (or SR Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification#Diesel_Electric_Multiple_Units|6L) diesel-electric multiple units were built from 1957 to 1958 at Eastleigh railway works and Ashford, Kent|Ashford railway works. These units were built to work the Charing Cross railway station|London Charing Cross to Hastings services. Several tunnels along the route had restricted clearance, so these units were built with a narrow body profile.
