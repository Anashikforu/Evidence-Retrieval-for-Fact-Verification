A '''GV star''', or  '''yellow dwarf''', is a main-sequence star. It is of Stellar classification|spectral type G and  luminosity class V on the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. The term ''yellow dwarf'' is a wikt:misnomer|misnomer, because G-type stars actually range in color from white, for more luminous types like the Sun, to only very slightly yellow for the less massive and luminous G-type main-sequence stars.
GV stars are small (about 0.8 to 1.0 solar masses) and have a surface temperature of between 5,300 and 6,000 Kelvin|K.Habets G M.H.J. and  Heintze J.R W. 1981. ''Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement'' '''46''', pp. 193â€“237. Tables VII, VIII. 
Our Sun is the most commonly known (and most easily seen) example of a GV star. Each second, it combines around 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium, changing about 4 million tons of matter to energy.
Our own Sun looks yellow through the Earth's atmosphere due to Rayleigh scattering. Without that, it would look white. Even though the name "dwarf" is used to compare yellow main sequence stars from giant stars, yellow dwarfs like the Sun are 90% brighter than all of the stars in the Milky Way (which are largely orange dwarfs, red dwarfs, and white dwarfs).

A GV star fuses hydrogen nuclei together and release energy for around 10 billion years. After the hydrogen is used up, the star will grow to many times its earlier size and become a red giant like  Aldebaran.SIMBAD,
