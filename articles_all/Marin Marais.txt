'''Marin Marais''' (31 May 1656, Paris – 15 August 1728, Paris) was a France|French composer and viol player.Jérôme de La Gorce and Sylvette Milliot. "Marais, Marin." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, , accessed February 1, 2016, 
Marais, the son of a poor shoe maker, was educated in a choir school were he was taught to play the viol. He then learnt from Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe, a famous bass viol player. In six months he was said to be better than his teacher. In 1675, aged 19, he joined the orchestra of the Paris Opera. This was where he met Jean-Baptiste Lully, who was the director of the Opera. Lully taught him to compose music. Marais often conducted the operas Lully had written.

Marais was hired as a musician in 1676 to play at the royal court of Palace of Versailles|Versailles. He did quite well as court musician. In 1679 he was appointed "ordinaire de la chambre du roy pour la viole", a title he kept until 1725.

He was a master of the viol|basse de viol. He wrote a lot of music for that instrument, he was the most important French composer for it. He wrote five books of ''Pièces de viole'' (1686-1725). Most of the pieces in the book are suites with basso continuo. These were quite popular in the court, and for these he was remembered in later years as he who "founded and firmly established the empire of the viol" (Hubert Le Blanc, 1740). His other works include a book of ''Pièces en trio'' (1692) and four operas (1693-1709). ''Alcyone'' (1706) is well known for its storm scene. Marais became the conductor of the Paris Opera in 1706, but after the failure of his 1709 opera, ''Sémélé'' he gradually withdrew from public life. He married Catherine d'Amicourt, on 21 September 1676. They had 19 children together. Two of the children, Vincent Marais and Roland Marais also became famous musicians, as well as his grandson, Nicolas Marais.
