The '''IMSAI 8080''' was an early microcomputer begun in late 1975, based on the Intel Corporation|Intel Intel 8080|8080 and later Intel 8085|8085 and the S-100 bus. It was Compatibility|compatible with its main Competition|competitor, the earlier Altair 8800|MITS Altair 8800, by which it was Inspiration|inspired. The IMSAI is largely thought of as the first "Clone (computer)|clone" computer. The IMSAI machine used a highly modified version of the CP/M|CP/M operating system called IMDOS. It was designed, made and sold by IMS Associates, Inc. (later renamed ''IMSAI Manufacturing Corp''). In total, between 17,000 and 20,000 units were produced from 1975 until 1978.

 History 
In May 1972, William Millard began business as ''IMS Associates'' (IMS) in the area of computer Computer consultant|consultancy and engineering, using his home as an office. By 1973, Millard began IMS Associates, Incorporation|Inc. Millard soon found Financial capital|capital for his business, and received several contracts, all for software.

In 1974, IMS was contacted by a client which wanted a "workstation system" that could do jobs for any General Motors new-car dealership. IMS planned a system including a Computer terminal|terminal, small computer, Computer printer|printer, and special software. Five of these work stations were to have common access to a hard disk, which would be controlled by a small computer. Eventually product wikt:development|development was stopped. Millard and his chief engineer Joe Killian turned to the microprocessor. Intel had wikt:announce|announced the 8080 chip, and compared to the 4004 to which IMS Associates had first used, the 8080 looked like a better idea. Full scale development of the IMSAI 8080 was begun, and by October 1975 an Advertising|advertisement was placed in the magazine ''Popular Electronics'', receiving positive reactions. Advertisement: IMSAI 8080 computer with 1K of RAM. $439 kit, $621 assembled.

IMS shipped the first IMSAI 8080 kits on December 16 1975. "Later that day, December 16 1975, United Parcel Service picked up the first shipment of 50 IMS computer kits for delivery to customers." In 1976, IMS was renamed to ''IMSAI Manufacturing Corporation'' because by then they were a manufacturing company, not a consultancy one. By October 1979 the IMSAI corporation had gone bankrupt, and the 'IMSAI' trademark was acquired by Thomas "Todd" Fischer and Nancy Freitas (former early employees of IMS Associates), who continued manufacturing the computers under the IMSAI name as a division of Fischer-Freitas Co. Support for early IMSAI systems continues to this day.

IMSAI in popular culture
An IMSAI 8080 and an acoustic coupler type modem were among the Hacker (computing)|hacking tools used by the main character in the 1983 movie ''WarGames''. However, even by 1983 the acoustic coupler was out of date. It was selected over a more modern model so that the audience would immediately recognize it as the device that connected to the telephone.
