'''Non-Euclidean geometry''' is a type of geometry. Non-Euclidean geometry only uses some of the "postulates" (wikt:assume|assumptions) that Euclidean geometry is based on. In normal geometry, parallel (geometry)|parallel lines can never meet. In non-Euclidean geometry they can meet, either infinitely many times (elliptic geometry), or never (hyperbolic geometry).

An example of Non-Euclidian geometry can be seen by drawing lines on a ball or other round object, straight lines that are parallel at the equator can meet at the poles

 Origin 
It is called "Non-Euclidean" because it is different from Euclidean geometry, which was discovered by an Ancient Greek mathematician called Euclid. The different names for non-Euclidean geometries came from thinking of "straight" lines as curved lines, either curved inwards like an ellipse, or outwards like a hyperbola.

The first authors of non-Euclidean geometries were the Hungary|Hungarian mathematician JÃ¡nos Bolyai and the Russian mathematician Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, who separately published treatises on hyperbolic geometry around 1830. As well Eugenio Beltrami published book on non-Eucludean geometry in 1868. Others, such as Carl Friedrich Gauss, had earlier ideas, but did not publish their ideas at the time.
