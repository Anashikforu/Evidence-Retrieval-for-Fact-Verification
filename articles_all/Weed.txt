A '''weed''' is a plant that people think is bad, because it is growing in the wrong place. Only smaller plants are often called weeds.

A person may grow a plant because it has beautiful flowers, but other people may think that this plant is a weed for some reason. This may be for one of these reasons:
It has pollen that makes them sneeze, 
It spreads seeds that will grow quickly, 
The roots go too far under the ground and can cause damage to houses or pipes, 
The roots spread quickly,
The plant has poisonous berry|berries,
The plant has liquid (sap) in it that can hurt a person's skin,

If someone is farming a plant and it then moves outside the farm, the plant may then be called a weed.

Some plants are very hard to stop once they start growing. These are called Invasive species|invasive weeds. 

Weed is also a name for any wild plant, one that people do not use for anything.
