'''''Der er et yndigt land''''' (International Phonetic Alphabet|pron. tɛɐ̯ ˈɛɐ̯ e̝t ˈøntit ˈlænˀ "tair AIR eht IHN-teet LAN"; lit. 'There is a Lovely Land') is the civil national anthem of Denmark. Adopted in 1835, Hans Ernst Krøyer composed the music in the same year, and the anthem's lyrics (words) were written by Adam Oehlenschläger in 1819. Denmark has another anthem called ''Kong Christian stod ved højen mast'', which is also officially used a national anthem but is usually reserved for royal and military purposes.
