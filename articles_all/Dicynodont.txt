The '''Dicynodontia''' are a sub-group of the extinct animals called therapsids. They were small to large herbivorous (plant-eating) animals with two tusks; 'dicynodont' means 'two dog tooth'. They are also the most successful and diverse of the non-mammalian therapsids, with over 70 genera (types) known.

All of them had the same basic body plan. They were built like small tanks, with sturdy legs at each corner. They were not fast movers, but were obviously strong and lived in groups rather as many plant-eaters do today.This is suggested by the discovery of a fossil toilet area used by ''Dinodontosaurus''. Morgan, James 2013. Giant prehistoric toilet unearthed. ''BBC Science & Environment''. 
Fossils discovered in Poland indicate that dicynodonts survived at least until about 200 million years ago (the Upper Triassic period. 
The dicynodonts were a group of therapsids, but were not ancestors to the mammals. The group which evolved into mammals was the cynodonts.
