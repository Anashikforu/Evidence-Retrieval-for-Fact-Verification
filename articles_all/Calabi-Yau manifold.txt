A '''Calabi&ndash;Yau manifold''', or 'Calabi&ndash;Yau space', is a special type of manifold. It is described in certain branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry.  

The Calabiâ€“Yau manifold's properties, such as Ricci flatness, have applications in theoretical physics. Particularly in superstring theory, the extra dimensions of spacetime might take the form of a 6-dimensional Calabi&ndash;Yau manifold. This led to the idea of  string theory mirror symmetry.
