'''Poales''' is a taxonomy|taxonomic order (biology)|order of flowering plants in the monocotyledons. The order includes family (biology)|families of plants such as the Poaceae|grasses, Bromeliaceae|bromeliads, and sedges.

The earliest fossils attributed to the Poales date to the late Cretaceous period about  million years ago, though some suggest the origin of the group may be 115 million years ago in South America.Bremer K. 2002. Gondwanan evolution of the grass alliance of families (Poales). ''Evolution'' '''56''': 1374–1387. 
The flowers are typically small, enclosed by bracts, and arranged in inflorescences (except in the  genus ''Mayaca'', with solitary terminal flowers). The flowers of many species are wind pollinated; the seeds usually contain starch.

One recent classification lists these families: Angiosperm Phylogeny Group 2009. An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III. ''Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society'' '''161''' (2): 105–121.

 Uses 
The Poales are the most economically important order of monocots and possibly the most important order of plants in general. Within the order, by far the most important family economically is the family of grasses (Poaceae, syn. Gramineae), which includes barley, maize, millet, rice, and wheat. It is also the largest family in the order, far outnumbering the other families:
 Poaceae: 12,070 species
 Cyperaceae: 5,500 species
 Bromeliaceae: 3,170 species
 Eriocaulaceae: 1,150 species
