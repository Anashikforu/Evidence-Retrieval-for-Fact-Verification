There were nine species (in six genera) of Moa.Ornithological Society of New Zealand: New Zealand recognised bird names (NZRBN) database 
The group of birds to which the moa belong had been in existence since the Cretaceous period. The MƒÅori people arrived in New Zealand from Oceania about a thousand years ago. Then, moas lived in large numbers, especially on South Island. Archaeology|Archaeological sites with evidence of moa hunting are all over New Zealand. The moas became extinct about five hundred years ago.Martin P.S. and Klein R.G. (eds) ''Quaternary extinctions: a prehistoric revolution''. University of Arizona Press, Tucson AZ. The moas had survived being hunted by Haast's eagle. However, they could not survive being hunted for food by the Maoris.

Recent extinctions (also mostly birds) have been caused by habitat change and introduced species.
