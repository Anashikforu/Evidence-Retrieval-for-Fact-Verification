The Pentateuch tells the story from the Creation myth|Creation of the world to the death of Moses and the preparation of the Israelite's to enter the land of Canaan.  The story is told in three parts.  The first part (Genesis 1-11) is about the Creation and the beginning of human beings on earth.  The second part (Genesis 12-50) are the stories of the wikt:ancestor|ancestors of the Israelites, mainly Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph. The third part, beginning with the book of Exodus, describes how the Israelite's left Ancient Egypt|Egypt and the early history of the people of Israel as a nation. It also has many laws about how the Israelite's must build their society. Deuteronomy is mostly Moses's final speech to his people and a summary of the Pentateuch.

The Pentateuch is most likely the oldest part of the Bible, however there is speculation that the book of Job could be older due to the similarities of Job to the patriarchal period, ie counting wealth in flocks and the sacrifices being performed by the patriarch of the household rather than a priest.
