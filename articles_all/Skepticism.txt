 The roots of skepticism 
Skepticism philosophical skepticism|on philosophy has its roots in ancient Greek philosophy.Long A.A. 1974. ''Hellenistic philosophy''.
Skepticism comes from Asia|Asian philosophy, too. The China|Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu|Zhuangzi (c369â€“c286 BC) said that what seems real could be just a dream.

The most important part of the argument is that unless we know ''something'' for certain, then we cannot know ''anything''. The interest lies in the way great philosophers have tried to solve this problem. Some, like Descartes, retreat into the mind: "I think, therefore I am." Others, such as the British empiricism|empiricists John Locke and David Hume,Hume D. 1739 ''Treatise'', and 1748. Enquiry into human understanding. would rely on our sense perception. Certain kinds of knowledge may be especially vulnerable to skepticism. For example, an agnostic believes people cannot get knowledge about supernatural things. 

Skepticism is widely used as a method for research in science, and (with changes) in modern legal procedure. Here doubt, suspending judgement, careful investigate|investigation, testing and discussion come before any statement of facts. Sometimes the process takes years before consensus is reached. This systematic approach is called ''methodological skepticism''. It is probably the most important legacy of the skeptics.
