A '''nursery''' is a place where plants are cultivated and grown to usable size. There are retail nurseries which sell to the general public, wholesale nurseries which sell only to other nurseries and to commercial landscape gardeners, and private nurseries which supply the needs of institutions or private estates.  Some retail and wholesale nurseries sell by mail.
