The '''Northern Isles''' Old Norse language|Old Norse: ''Nor√∞reyjar''; Scottish Gaelic language|Scots Gaelic: ''Na h-Eileanan Tuath''; Scots language|Scots: ''Northren Isles'' are a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland.

The group includes Shetland, Fair Isle and Orkney.  Sometimes Stroma, Scotland|Stroma is included, which is part of Caithness.

Culture and politics
The Northern Isles are usually separated for political purposes, but they come under the '''Orkney and Shetland''' parliamentary constituency in Westminster.

Due to their history, the islands have a Norse, rather than a Gaelic flavour, and have historic links with the Faroe Islands|Faroes, Iceland, and Norway.

Orkney and Shetland were given to Scotland as a deposit on the dowry of Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret of Denmark when she married James III of Scotland in 1469.
