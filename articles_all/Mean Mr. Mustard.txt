"'''Mean Mr. Mustard'''" is a song written by John Lennon

Composition

Written in India, Lennon said that the song was inspired by a newspaper story about a miser who hid his cash wherever he could so he can stop people from making him spend it. On reflection, he didn't think highly of the composition, describing it in ''The Beatles Anthology|Anthology'' as "a bit of crap I wrote in India."

A demo version of the song was recorded in May 1968 at Kinfauns (George Harrison)|Kinfauns, George Harrison's home in Esher, and appears on Anthology 3. Additionally, the original version of the song was a quieter acoustic rendition and was over 4 minutes in length.

Other versions

The version in the ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' film was performed by Mean Mr. Mustard (played by Frankie Howerd) and his evil robot companions named the Computerettes. As with the performance of "She's Leaving Home" also in the film, the computerized singing of the Computerettes was performed by the Bee Gees.
