Up to the advent of Christianity the term was not used like that in the Greek-speaking world. Orthodoxy is opposed to ''heterodoxy'' ('other teaching'), ''heresy'' and ''Schism (religion)|schism''. People who profess a doctrine considered to be false by the majority are most often called heretics. People who separate themselves from the body of believers, i.e. from full communion, are called schismatics. -->

Orthodoxy or "correct" belief is not subjective.
