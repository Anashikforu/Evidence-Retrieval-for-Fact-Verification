'''Revenue''' (or '''revenues''') is income that an organization receives from its normal business activities. It does not include the cost required to create these goods and services, which is considered "profit". In addition to sale of goods and services, some companies also receive revenue from interest, dividends or royalties paid to them by other companies.
