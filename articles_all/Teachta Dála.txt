A '''Teachta Dála''', is a member of Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Ireland|Irish parliament.  Usually only the initials '''TD''' are used, after the person's name.

The letters are used in the same way that Member of Parliament|MP is used to show that someone is a Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom.
