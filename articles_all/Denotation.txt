:''For the opposite of Denotation see Connotation.''

In logic, linguistics and semiotics, a '''denotation''' of a word or phrase is a part of its meaning. 

Examples
In order to understand fully the difference between denotation and connotation in the media studies and semiotics uses it is necessary to become familiar with some examples:

 Different aspects of meaning 

Several parts of meaning may be called denotation. That depends on the contrast being drawn.
 ''Connotation and denotation'' are either
in basic semantics and literary theory, the ''figurative'' and ''literal'' meanings of a word, or
in philosophy, logic and parts of linguistics, the intension and extension of a word
 ''Denotation'' can be synonymous with '''reference''' in the sense and reference in philosophy of language.

 In Computer science, denotational semantics is contrasted with operational semantics.

 In Semiotics, denotation (Semiotics)|denotation also has its own meaning.

In mass media|media-studies terminology, '''denotation''' is the first level of analysis: what the audience can visually see on a page. Denotation often refers to something literal, and avoids being a metaphor. Here it is usually coupled with connotation which is the second level of analysis, being what the denotation represents

In logic and semantics, denotational always attracts the Extension_(semantics)|extension meaning "in the pair", but the other element genuinely varies. See intension for some more discussion.

A denotation is the strict, literal, dictionary definition of a word, devoid of any emotion, attitude, or colour. 

Denotation often links with symbolism, as the denotation of a particular media text often represents something further; a hidden meaning (or an Engima Code) is often encoded into a media text (such as the images below).
