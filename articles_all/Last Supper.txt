The Synoptic Gospels all tell of Jesus using the bread and wine as symbols of his body and blood.  the Gospel of John does not include those details but tells of Jesus washing the feet of the disciples.  This has led to some Christian groups having a ritual of foot washing as a sign of humility. 

The Last Supper is commemorated by Christians especially on Maundy Thursday.
