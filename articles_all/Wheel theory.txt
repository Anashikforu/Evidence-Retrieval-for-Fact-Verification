'''Wheel theory''' is the theory of wheels. A wheel is an algebraic structure where division by 0 has meaning. The term ''wheel'' was inspired by the topological picture \odot.

 Definition 
A wheel is an algebraic structure satisfying(for all values x, y, and z):

 Addition and multiplication are commutative and associative, with 0 and 1 as their respective identities.
 //x = x
 /(xy) = /y/x
 xz + yz = (x + y)z + 0z
 (x + yz)/y = x/y + z + 0y
 0\cdot 0 = 0
 (x+0y)z = xz + 0y
 /(x+0y) = /x + 0y
 0/0 + x = 0/0

Wheels replace the usual division with a :en:Unary_operation|unary operator applied to one argument /x similar (but not identical) to the multiplicative inverse x^{-1}, such that a/b becomes shorthand for a \cdot /b = /b \cdot a. Also, \bot replaces the fraction 0/0.
