The '''fall of Constantinople''' was when the Ottoman Empire took over Constantinople, the capital city of the Byzantine Empire, on 29 May 1453. The Ottomans were commanded by 21-year-old Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II, who defeated an army commanded by Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. The conquest of Constantinople followed a 53-day siege started on 6 April 1453.

This event marks the end of the Byzantine Empire, and so it was the end of the Roman Empire, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years.Momigliano, Arnaldo & Schiavone, Aldo 1997.

Some places, like the Peloponnese|Morea Despotate and Empire of Trebizond were not defeated by the Ottomans until several years later.

The fall of Constantinople had important results, because the Ottoman Turkish people|Turks at last had control of the Balkans. Nothing could stop them from further Muslim conquests in Europe, which went on until after the Battle of Vienna in 1683.
