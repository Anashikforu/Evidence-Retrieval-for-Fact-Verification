A '''sweatshop''' is a place where people work, that is very crowded, where the work is very hard and the place is not safe to work in. Many sweatshops are in poor countries but sweatshops are also found in rich countries, where they often have people who are new to the country working in them, or people who are not Illegal alien|legal residents. The amount of money people are paid in sweatshops is lower than the amount paid to workers in a richer country, but is often higher than the worker would earn in their old jobs on farms, or working in manual labour.
