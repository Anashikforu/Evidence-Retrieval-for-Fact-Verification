A '''metal detector''' is a tool a person can use to help find metal nearby. It is useful for finding metal within other objects, or for finding metal underground. Most metal detectors will make a sound or have a needle move on a sensor in order to show where objects are. Most of the tiem a metal detector will tell you how close you are to an object - for example, by making a higher-pitched sound when you are closer to an object.

History of the metal detector
Alexander Graham Bell invented a kind of metal detector in 1881 in a to try and find the bullet in President James Garfield's body after he had been shot. The metal detector worked but it was confused between the bullet and a coiled bed-spring which he had been lying on. Gerhard Fischer made a better version in the 1920s but the detector got confused when someone was approaching ore-bearing rocks. He was given a patent in 1925.

A businessman named Shirl Herr had also tried to get a patent for a metal detector but was not given one until 1928.

Uses
A metal detector can be used by archaeologists for finding things like metallic coins, bullets, and jewellery underneath or inside a surface.
