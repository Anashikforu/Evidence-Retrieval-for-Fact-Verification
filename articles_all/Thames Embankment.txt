The '''Thames Embankment''' is a major feat of 19th century civil engineering. It reclaimed marshy land next to the River Thames in central London. 

 Overview 
The Embankment now runs on the northern side of the river from Palace of Westminster|Parliament in Westminster to the City of London. It is a continuous four-lane road (mostly a double carriageway). It connects with all the bridges along the route from Westminster Bridge to Blackfriars Bridge.

It was built in two parts, the Victoria Embankment|Victoria and the Chelsea Embankment, but it is now unified. Londoners regard it as a single road, the Embankment. There is a much smaller road on the south side of the river, called the Albert Embankment.
