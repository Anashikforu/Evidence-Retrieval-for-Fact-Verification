A '''corvette''' is a small, manageable and lightly armed war ship. During the Age of the Sail, corvettes were smaller than frigates and larger than sloop-of-war|sloops-of-war, they had normally a single gun deck. Almost all the modern Navy|navies use ships smaller than frigates for coastal duty, but not all of them use the term ''corvette'' (from the French ''corvair'') or equivalent.
