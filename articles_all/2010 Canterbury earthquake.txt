New Zealand sits on the Plate boundary|boundary between the Australian plate|Australian and Pacific plates. In the South Island, these plates mainly slide past each other horizontally, producing earthquakes along fault (geology)|fault lines such as the Alpine fault. The 2010 earthquake was centred about 80â€“90&nbsp;km to the southeast of the plate boundary through the island, probably on one of a network of smaller faults linked to the main faults that mark the plate boundary itself.
