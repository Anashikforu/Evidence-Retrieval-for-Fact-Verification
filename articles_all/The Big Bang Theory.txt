'''''The Big Bang Theory''''' is an United States|American television sitcom. It was created and executive producer|executive produced by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady. It was first shown on CBS on September 24, 2007.
 Overview 
The show starts by being centred on two male California Institute of Technology|Caltech scientists who share an apartment in Pasadena, California. They are in their twenties and are both single for the first two seasons. One is an experimental physicist from New Jersey (Leonard Hofstadter). The other is a theoretical physicist from Texas (Sheldon Cooper). Sheldon has Asperger syndrome and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and has a very low sex drive. They live across the hall from an attractive, bottle-blonde waitress from Nebraska (Penny (The Big Bang Theory character)|Penny). She is single and lives on her own for most of the show's run. She tried to become an actress, but only got a role in a television advertisement and a role in a B-movie called Serial Apeist as well as its sequel.

Leonard and Sheldon's geekiness and intellect are contrasted with Penny's social skills, popularity and lively sex life for comedic effect. Two equally geeky, single friends of Sheldon and Leonard's, Jewish Howard Wolowitz|Howard and Indian Rajesh Koothrappali|Rajesh, are also main characters. Howard lived with his mother during the first few seasons. Raj lives on his own. The show is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions.

The show began as a sitcom about four geeky, male scientists and their fun-loving, under-educated, socially successful waitress neighbour. Much of the humor revolved around the differences between scientists and the rest of the characters, especially Penny. From season 3 onwards, the show changed greatly into being a show about couples and families. Bernadette Rostenkowski was brought in during season 3 and started a relationship with Howard. The couple later married and had a daughter. Amy Farrah-Fowler was also brought in during season 3 and started a relationship with Sheldon; they later got engagement|engaged. Leonard and Penny became a couple and married.

Eleven seasons have been shown. The show's twelfth season was its last.

A prequel series, ''Young Sheldon'', began in 2017.

Series overview


 Production history 
The show was first developed for the 2006-2007 television season. At that time, it was very different from the show that was later broadcast. Only Jim Parsons & Johnny Galecki were part of the original pilot. The character now played by Kaley Cuoco was much meaner to the geeks. CBS did not pick the show up, but gave Bill Prady and Chuck Lorre a second chance. They brought in Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar. They retooled the show.

The second pilot of ''The Big Bang Theory'' was directed by award-winning television directing veteran James Burrows. He decided not to stay with the show. This reworked pilot led to a 13-episode order by CBS on May 14, 2007.

Production on the show was halted on November 6, 2007 by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike.

The show returned on March 17, 2008 . It had an earlier time slot The second season premiered, in the same slot, on September 22, 2008. During that season, the show's ratings grew. That led to a 
two-year renewal through the 2010-11 season.

David Saltzberg, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, checks scripts and provides dialogue, math equations and diagrams used as props. He says he is more consultant than contributor.

 Theme song 
Barenaked Ladies wrote and recorded the theme song, which describes developments the universe has undergone since the dawn of time. On October 9, 2007, a full-length (1 minute and 45 second) version of the song was released.
