A '''cuboid''' is a 3D shape. Cuboids have six faces, which form a convex polyhedron. Broadly, the faces of the cuboid can be any quadrilateral. More narrowly, rectangular cuboids are made from 6 rectangles, which are placed at right angles. A cuboid that uses all Square (geometry)|square faces is a cube.
Properties of a Cuboid are:
 It has 12 edges
 It has 8 corners or vertices
 It has 6 faces.
The basic difference between a rectangle and a cuboid is that one is a 2D shape and the other is a 3D shape.

The basic difference between a cube and cuboid is that a cube has equal length, height and breadth whereas in cuboids these three may or may not be the same.
The cuboid can also be called a right rectangular prism.

Where l= length, b= breadth, h= height:
 Total Surface Area of Cuboid = 2(l×b+b×h+h×l) 
 Volume of Cuboid = L×B×H
