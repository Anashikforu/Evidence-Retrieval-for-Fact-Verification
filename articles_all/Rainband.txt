A '''rainband''' is an area of rainfall where all the clouds and Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation are stretched out in a long line or band.Glossary of Meteorology (2009). 
Rainbands that form near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which can produce tornadoes. The shape of rainbands linked with cold fronts can be changed by mountains. The mountains block the winds which can then form a low-level barrier jet. Bands of thunderstorms can form when sea breeze and land breezes meet, if enough moisture is present. Sometimes sea breeze rainbands which are ahead of a cold front, can hide the location of the cold front itself. Rainbands in an extratropical cyclone can cause large amounts of rain or snow. Behind extratropical cyclones, rainbands can form downwind of large, warmer bodies of water such as the Great Lakes. If the air is cold enough, these rainbands can cause heavy snowfalls.

Extratropical cyclones

Rainbands ahead of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts have little upward motion.Owen Hertzman (1988).

Rainbands exist on the edges of tropical cyclones, and point towards the cyclone's center of low pressure area|low pressure.Glossary of Meteorology (2009). 
Forced by geography
Convective rainbands can form parallel mountains on their windward side. This is due to lee waves triggered by hills just upstream of the cloud's formation.Daniel J. Kirshbaum, George H. Bryan, Richard Rotunno, and Dale R. Durran (2006).
