'''Pig''' is a jeopardy (risk) dice game played with one dice|die.  In jeopardy dice games, a player decides to ''roll'' or ''hold'' (stop rolling).  A player that rolls risks a turn total, and may gain a higher turn total or score nothing.  A player that holds scores the turn total.

John Scarne wrote about Pig as a common dice game in 1945.Scarne, John. 1945. Scarne on Dice. Harrisburg, PA: Military Service Publishing Co.  Optimal (perfect) play has been computed.Todd W. Neller and Clifton G.M. Presser. Teachers often use Pig for fun lessons.
 Rules 
On a player's turn, a player can '''roll''' or '''hold''':
'''roll:''' The player can roll a dice|die.
When a player rolls a 1 (called a "pig"), the turn ends and the player score does not change.
When a player rolls a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, the turn continues and the player adds the roll to the turn total.
'''hold:''' The player says "hold" and gives the die to the next player.
When a player "holds", the turn ends and the player adds the turn total to the score.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

= Example Play =

For example, Ann begins a turn with a roll of 5.  She could hold and score 5 points, but she decides to roll again.  Next, Ann rolls a 2.  She could hold with a turn total of 7 points (2 + 5 = 7), but she decides to roll again.  Next, Ann rolls a 1 ("pig").  She must end her turn.  Her score does not change.  She hands the dice to the next player, Bob.

Bob rolls a 4, 5, 3, 5, and 5.  He then decides to hold.  Bob adds 4 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 22 points to his score.
