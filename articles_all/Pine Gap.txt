'''Pine Gap''' is a remote facility 19&nbsp;km (12 miles) southwest of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia. 

In the late 1960's, a treaty was signed between the United States and Australia to establish a joint Intelligence agency|intelligence facility to monitor and track Soviet Union|Soviet missile capabilities. Whilst most activities are highly classified, it is widely believed that, more recently, Pine Gap controls Satellite (artificial)|satellites which are used to monitor foreign satellites from Russia, China, North Korea, India and Pakistan, among others, as well as controlling surveillance systems that provide early warning for Nuclear weapon|nuclear attacks against the United States, missile defense systems, heat signature detection of military aircraft, battlefield intelligence and space warfare monitoring.

Conspiracies exist which link the site to covert programs for monitoring and testing of laser weaponry for satellite and space based attack/defense and secret control of Unidentified flying object|UFO's.

Pine Gap employs about 1000 American and Australians and is responsible for about 2,000 people in the Alice Springs region who are US citizens. The US influence in the area is evident by American sports such as baseball and American football. Similarly, the celebration of American festivals which are normally not active in Australia, such as Halloween, Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day and Thanksgiving also showcase the US cultural influence. A number of Australians join in the festivities from time to time.
