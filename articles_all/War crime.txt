A '''war crime''' is a crime that happens in a war.  There are international laws of war that say what people can do during wars and what they cannot do. A war crime breaks these rules.

Today, these rules are international laws called the Geneva Conventions and the Hague Convention.

Definition
To be a war crime, a crime must be part of a plan, or the crime has to be committed against many people and must be committed during a war.

The idea of what a "war crime" is has changed over time.  For example, during World War I, using Chemical weapons in World War I|poison gas in combat was not thought of as a war crime.  Now it is.

In 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) was created. Its goal is to look into and, if possible, Punishment|punish people for war crimes.  When the ICC was created, it came up with a longer list of war crimes.  For example, its list was the first one to include types of sexual abuse like forcing women into sexual slavery.pp.&nbsp;8â€“10
