'''Stevens' power law''' is a proposed relationship between the Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude of a physical stimulus and the intensity or strength that people feel.

Most people think that it describes a wider range of sensations than Weber-Fechner law. But critics argue that the validity of the law is not sure.

The theory is named after psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens (1906â€“1973).  Although the idea of a power law had been suggested by 19th century researchers, Stevens is credited with reviving the law and publishing a body of psychophysical data to support it in 1956.

The general form of the law is
:\psi(I) = k I ^a , \,\!
where  I is the magnitude of the physical stimulus, \psi is the psychophysical function capturing sensation (the subjective size of the stimulus), a is an exponent that depends on the type of stimulation and k is a proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality constant that depends on the type of stimulation and the units used.

The table to the right lists the exponents reported by Stevens.
