'''Egyptian Islamic Jihad''' (EIJ), ('''EIJ'''), formerly called simply '''Islamic Jihad''' '''الجهاد الإسلامي''' and ''Liberation Army for Holy Sites''.Global Briefings, Issue 27, September 1998, “Osama Bin Laden tied to other fundamentalists”. originally called '''al-Jihad'''," and then "the Jihad Group", or "the Jihad Organization"Wright, Lawrence, ''Looming Tower,'' Knopf, 2006, p.123 is an Egyptian terrorist group based on an extreme interpretation of Islam. It has been active since the late 1970s. It is under worldwide embargo by the United Nations as a group linked to al-Qaeda.
Since 1991 it has been led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is now the leader of al-Qaeda. According to Zawahiri, the EIJ was "different from the Takfir wal-Hijra|Takfir wal Hijra group as we do not consider people infidels because of their sins. And we are different from the Muslim Brotherhood because sometimes they do not oppose the government".al-Zayat, Montasser 2002. ''The road to al-Qaeda''.

The organization's original main goal was to overthrow the Egyptian government and replace it with an Islamic state based on the way it thought Islam should be. Later it broadened its aims to include attacking the United States and Israel, and other interests in Egypt and abroad.

Islamic Jihad was responsible for the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981. Sadat's Sinai treaty with Israel, which recognized the Jewish state, made them very angry.
