The British Rail '''Class 09''' is a class of 0-6-0 diesel locomotive designed primarily for shunt (railway operations)|shunting but also short distance freight trips along branch lines. For this reason, though similar to the existing British Rail Class 08|Class 08 shunting locomotives, Class 09s were re-geared to give a maximum top speed of 27.5&nbsp;mph (44&nbsp;km/h) at the expense of a lower tractive effort. They originally operated in the Southern Region of British Railways, though following privatisation in 1997 they have been distributed much farther afield.
