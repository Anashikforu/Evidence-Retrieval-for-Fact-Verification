'''''Kirby Super Star Ultra''''' is a remake of ''Kirby Super Star'', a video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released for the Nintendo DS in 2008.

''Kirby Super Star Ultra'' has every game that the original ''Kirby Super Star'' has, along with new games. The new games are:

'''''Revenge of the King:''''' A traditional ''Kirby'' platformer. It is like ''Spring Breeze'', but harder.
'''''Meta Knightmare Ultra:''''' Meta Knight prepares for the "ultimate battle". It is a game where you play as Meta Knight and control him through various actions on the touch screen.
'''''Helper to Hero:''''' A version of ''Arena'' where the player takes control of the helper characters.
'''''True Arena:''''' A version of ''Arena'' which has the bosses from ''Revenge of the King''. It also has a new boss called Marx Soul.
'''Sub-games:''' There are three new sub-games: Snack Tracks, Kirby Swipe, and Kirby on the Draw. They use the console's touch screen and can be played with up to four players.
