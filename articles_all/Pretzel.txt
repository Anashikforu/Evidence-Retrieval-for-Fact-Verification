A '''pretzel''' (French language|French: ''Bretzel'', Alsatian language|Alsatian: ''bradchdal'', German language|German: ''Breze'' or ''Brezel'') is a baked snack that originated in Germany. It is traditionally twisted into a unique knot-like shape. The pretzel dough is made from wheat flour and yeast. Before baking, it is dipped into "Natronlauge" (, sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) or sodium carbonate solution (Na2CO3)) and sprinkled with coarse salt. During baking, a Maillard reaction then gives the pretzel its characteristic brown color and distinctive flavor. In Bavaria, it is obligatory in a Wei√üwurst breakfast.

Because they are made mostly of wheat, pretzels can be problematic for people who have wheat allergy, coeliac disease, or wheat intolerances.

There are different types of pretzels, like chocolate pretzels.
