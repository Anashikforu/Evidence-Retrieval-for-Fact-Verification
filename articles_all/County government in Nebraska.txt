'''County government in Nebraska''' is organized in two ways:
Township counties: the county is divided into civil township|townships and governed by a 7-member board of supervisors. 27 counties are governed this way.
Commissioner counties: the county is governed by a 3- or 5-member board of commissioners, but is ''not'' divided into organized townships. 66 counties are governed in this way.
