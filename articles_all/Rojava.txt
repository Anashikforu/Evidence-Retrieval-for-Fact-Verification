'''Rojava''', or '''Western Kurdistan''', or '''Syrian Kurdistan''', is a part of divided Kurdistan in the Middle East. It consists of three areas called 'cantons' in Northern Syria but the Syrian government is not in control there. Instead, since a revolution which happened early on in the Syrian Civil War, it has had its own wikt:independent|independent government, although it does not claim to be a new independent country, calling itself a 'federal autonomous region' inside of Syria instead.

Many people in Rojava are Kurdish people|Kurds, but there are also many different ethnic groups living there, such as Turkmen people|Turkmen, Arab people|Arabs, Syriacs, Assyrian people|Assyrians, and Yazidi|Yezidis. Kurds are the largest ethnic minority group in Syria. Before the civil war, many human rights organizations such as Amnesty International said that the Syrian government treated the Kurds very poorly. Kurds in Syria are not allowed to officially use the Kurdish language, and also  not allowed to register children with Kurdish names, start businesses that do not have Arabic language|Arabic names, build Kurdish private schools, or publish any books or other materials written in Kurdish. But this is no longer enforced due to the civil war.

This gave the Kurds many reasons to support a revolution against the government. They also needed to organize an army to defend themselves from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) which almost took control of Rojava because the government could not defend it due to the civil war. ISIL is still at war with Rojava. As of 2017, there is a Ceasefire|truce between Rojava and the Syrian government. The United States have given money and weapons to Rojava to help  defeat ISIL but some say that they are supporting ISIL.

Rojava is claiming to be a democracy. It has a constitution which says that women's rights and the rights of ethnic and religious minorities have to be respected. In the Middle East this is very unusual. There are two military organisations one for men, the YPG, and an army for women, the YPJ.

 History 
The Kurds are the largest ethnic group (''group of people'') in the world that does not have its own state.

In the 7th century AD, the Muslim conquests of the Ancient Near East meant that Kurdistan became part of the Rashidun Empire.

The Kurdish Ayyubid dynasty (''line of rulers'') rose to power in the 10th century, as the power of the Abbasid Caliphate fell.

The armies of the Mongol Empire attacked Ayyubid Syria in the middle of the 13th century.

Sharaf Khan Bidlisi wrote the ''Sharafnama'' in 1596.

At the start of the 17th century, the Ottoman Sultan|Ottoman Sultans ordered Kurds from different parts of their empire to move to the area around the Euphrates river.

The result of World War I (1914—1918) was very important for the history of the Kurds.

When the fighting was completed in World War I and the Arab Revolt, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain and French Third Republic|France suggested a Kurdish state could be set up. However, neither country wanted to pull back their armies from the lands that had been Ottoman (the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration).

The British and French governments did not want to move their armies back, and because of this they said any Kurdish state would have to be in parts of Kurdistan controlled by Turkey in August 1920, when the Ottomans, British, and French all signed the Treaty of Sèvres. The Turks did not fully agree to (ratify) this treaty (''agreement between nations''), but it would have brought into existence a small independent Kurdistan under French control (suzerainty).

The Turkish National Movement led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and the Kemalism|Kemalists (''supporters of Atatürk'') did not agree to the Treaty of Sèvres.

In 1923, Turkey and the Great power|great powers (''most powerful nations'') agreed the Treaty of Lausanne. Thomas Schmidinger, a German Anthropology|cultural anthropologist wrote that modern Rojava, or Syrian Kurdistan, came into existence as "a waste product of the Colonialism|colonial wikt:divison|division of the Middle East" south of the Berlin–Baghdad railway line.

On the south side of the railway line, in French Syria, some mostly Kurdish areas came under the control of France. These Kurdish areas were around the Kurd Mountains (Kurd-Dagh), around the town of Jarabulus, and the lands in Upper Mesopotamia (the Northern Jazira).

The new borders meant that the Kurdish people in the area were divided into two groups, with two different governments. However, they were able to come and go across the border: there was at first no material separation.

The French government's wikt:settlement|settlement of Kurdish refugees in the Jazira made Kurdishness a political subject in Syria.

The brothers Celadet Bedir Khan and Kamuran Alî Bedirxan started to use the Latin alphabet, which then became normal in Syrian Kurdistan and in Turkish Kurdistan.

In 1924, Kurdish wikt:delegate|delegate from the Kurd Mountains made a wikt:petition|petition to the French Syrian government, requesting for self-rule in Kurdish-majority lands in French Syria.


= Syrian Republic (1946–1963) =
Syria was given independence in 1946.

Oil was discovered in Syrian Kurdistan in the 1960s. At the same time, events in Iraqi Kurdistan meant that the lives of the Kurdish population Syria became much worse.

In 1962 the Syrian government started the Arab Belt plan to "save Arabism" and stop the "Kurdish threat". The Arab Belt plan was to move the Kurdish population away from the Syria–Turkey border. In the Kurds' place, the government would move more Arabs onto the land. The Kurds would be moved to other parts of Syria, away from one another. The government's decision was made after the discovery of an oil field at Qaratchok, in the Kurdish Jazira. Much of the land in the Arab Belt was fertile arable land (''for growing crops'') and had rich oil fields.


= Syrian Arab Republic (1963–2011) =
Things became worse for the Kurdish population when the Nationalism|ultra-nationalist Ba'ath Party of Michel Aflaq took power by a 1963 Syrian coup d'état|coup d'état in Damascus in March 1963.

# wikt:dispossession|dispossession (''batr'')  the Kurds were to be moved off the land and made to live somewhere different
# wikt:obscurantism|obscurantism (''tajhil'')  education of the Kurds was to be stopped, including teaching in Arabic language
# famine (''tajwii'')  Kurds were to be taken out of employment
# extradition  refugees from Turkish Kurdistan were to be handed over into Turkish Arrest|custody
# wikt:factionalism|factionalism  arguments between Kurdish political groups were to be encouraged, to weaken them by divide and rule
# the Arab Belt (''hizam'')  Arabs were to be moved onto old Kurdish lands, as the government had planned in 1962
# colonization (''iskan'')  "pure and nationalist Arabs" were to be moved into Syrian Kurdistan so Kurds might be "watched until their wikt:dispersion|dispersion"
# the Syrian Army was to be sent to the lands in the Arab Belt, to help the government complete the plan
# "Socialism|socialization"  "collective farms" (''mazarii jama'iyya'') were to be built on the Kurds' old lands. Arabs would be brought to live in them and given training and weapons by the government
# "anybody wikt:ignorant|ignorant of the Arabic language" was to be stopped from voting in elections or holding political office
# Kurdish ''ulemas'' (''Muslim religious teachers'') were to be moved away to the south and replaced with Arabs
# "a wikt:vast|vast anti-Kurdish wikt:campaign|campaign amongst the Arabs" was to be begun by the government

Many of these steps were taken over the following years and the Arab Belt continued to be the government's plan. The government built the "model villages" in an area stretching from Amuda to Derik, Syria|Derik, with some near Qamishli. The government gave Derik (a Kurdish name) the new Arabic language name ''al-Malikiyah''. Water from the new Lake Assad wikt:flooded|flooded the lands of Arabs living in the Euphrates wikt:valley|valley when Syria built the Tabqa Dam. The Arabs whose lands were flooded were moved to the mostly Kurdish al-Jazira Province.

The Ba'athist government moved slowly, in order not to get attention from other countries. In the Kurd Mountains, the government's land reforms mostly wikt:redistributed|redistributed land to Kurdish farmers, but in other parts of Syria, the government took many Kurds' lands and gave them to Arabs. Even in the Kurd Mountains, which were outside the lands of the Arab Belt in al-Jazira Province, all schools taught in Arabic language only and Kurdish language was wikt:marginalized|marginalized in public life.

In 1976, Hafez al-Assad stopped the Arab Belt plan going any further by not building any more Arab villages. The villages the government had built and the Arabs the government had moved wikt:stayed|stayed where they were.
