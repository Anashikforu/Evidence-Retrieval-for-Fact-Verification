The '''aye-aye''' (''Daubentonia madagascariensis'') is a lemur which lives  in rain forests of Madagascar, a large island off the southeast coast of Africa.(madagascar) 

This solitary animal is nocturnal (most active at night). The aye-aye spends most of its time in trees. During the day, it sleeps in a nest  in the fork of a tree. It builds the nest out of leaves and twigs. 

The aye-aye has rodent-like teeth and a special thin middle finger to get at the insect larva|grubs under tree bark. It fills the same ecological niche as  woodpeckers do elsewhere. It taps on trees to find grubs, then gnaws holes in the wood using its forward slanting incisors. Then it sticks in its middle finger to pull the grubs out.Erickson C.J. ''et al'' 1998.
