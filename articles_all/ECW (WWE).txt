'''ECW''' (which at one time stood for '''Extreme Championship Wrestling''') was a professional wrestling WWE Brand Extension|brand of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), based on the independent Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion that lasted from 1992 to 2001. It started on June 13, 2006 with a weekly television series. The ECW brand was one of WWE's three brands, the other two being WWE Raw|RAW and WWE SmackDown|SmackDown.

Show history
=Original format=
WWE got Extreme Championship Wrestling and its WWE Video Library|video library in 2003 and later began reintroducing ECW through a series of DVDs and books. The big popularity of ECW merchandise prompted WWE to organize WWE One Night Stand#2005|ECW One Night Stand, an ECW reunion pay-per-view in 2005. The financial and critical success of the event encourages WWE to start a second One Night Stand (2006)|One Night Stand the next year. With rejuvenated interest in the ECW product, WWE began exploring the possibility of reviving the promotion full-time. On May 26, 2006, WWE announced the launch of ECW as a stand-alone WWE Brand Extension|brand, congruous to WWE Raw|Raw and WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!, with its own show on the Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel. Sci Fi Channel is owned by NBC Universal, parent company of USA Network and exclusive cable broadcaster of WWE programming.

The ECW brand initially tried to differentiate itself from WWE's other brands. The hard cameras were placed in a different location and the ring mat had an ECW logo on it. The male performers were also referred to as "Extremists" as opposed to Superstars, and female performers were called "Vixens" instead of WWE Diva|Divas. It also had the first ECW talent. Later however, changes were made to differentiate it from the original ECW promotion, including changing the original promotion's rules where weapons were legal in all matches and there were rarely any Professional wrestling#Countout|count outs or Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualifications. WWE now classifies such matches as having "Hardcore wrestling|Extreme Rules", and are only fought when specified. The only pay-per-view event hosted exclusively by the ECW brand since its launch was December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember in December 2006. On March 14, 2007, before another one could be scheduled, WWE announced that all future pay-per-views would feature all three brands.

Former ECW owner Paul Heyman served as the on air "ECW Representative". According to an interview in the UK newspaper The Sun, Heyman wrote the brand's weekly scripts and gave them to writers for possible changes, and then Vince McMahon for final approval. After the December to Dismember 2006 Heyman was relieved from both his on and off air duties with World Wrestling Entertainment. After Heyman left, there was no ECW authority figure until August 14, 2007, when Hazem Ali|Armando Estrada was announced as the General Manager.

=ECW on Sci Fi=
ECW's weekly series was first given a thirteen episode run as a "summer series" on the Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel. The first episode got a 2.79 Nielsen Ratings|rating, making it the highest rated show on cable in its time slot.

While the show started out a ratings success, it began drawing criticism from fans of the original ECW early on. This was most evident by the Heat (professional wrestling)#X-Pac heat|negative crowd reaction "old school" fans gave the main event of Dave Bautista|Batista vs. Big Show|the Big Show at the show of August 1, 2006 from Hammerstein Ballroom.

On October 16, 2007 a "talent exchange" was started between the WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown! and ECW brands, allowing their respective talent to appear on either brand.

=Online presence=
At ECW's launch, WWE.com introduced '''Hardcore Hangover''', a video feature which allowed fans only in the United States to stream or download video footage from the weekly show.

Production
ECW brand shows are held in big arenas as a part of the WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown! brand's Tuesday taping schedule. This is in sharp contrast to the first Extreme Championship Wrestling which ran most of its events in smaller venues.

ECW's initial theme song was "Bodies (Drowning Pool song)|Bodies" by Drowning Pool, which had been used by WWE for Extreme Championship Wrestling since before the brand was established. Since then the theme song has changed between a number of different songs before settling on "''Don't Question My Heart''", sung by Kyle Morrison of the band Shattersphere. A remix of "''Don't Question My Heart''" by Saliva (band)|Saliva featuring Brent Smith is now used.
Starting with the January 22, 2008 version, ''ECW'' began broadcasting in High-definition television|HD, along with a new HD set, which is shared among all three WWE brands.
