In thermodynamics, the '''internal energy''' of a thermodynamic system, or a physical body|body with well-defined dimension|boundaries, denoted by&nbsp;''U'', or sometimes&nbsp;''E'', is the total of the kinetic energy due to the motion of molecules (translation (physics)|translational, rotational, oscillation|vibrational) and the potential energy associated with the vibrational and electricity|electric energy of atoms within molecules or crystals. It includes the energy in all the chemical bonds, and the energy of the free, electrical conduction|conduction electrons in metals. 

The internal energy is a thermodynamic potential and for a closed system|closed thermodynamic thermodynamic system|system held at constant entropy, it will be Principle of minimum energy|minimized.

One can also calculate the internal energy of electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic or black body|blackbody radiation. It is a state function of a system, an extensive quantity. The SI unit of energy is the joule although other historical, conventional units are still in use, such as the (small and large) calorie for heat. (Calories that are on classic food labels are actually kilo-calories.)

 Overview 
''Internal'' energy does not include the translational or rotational kinetic energy of a body ''as a whole''. It also does not include the special relativity|relativistic mass-energy equivalent ''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mc''2. It excludes any potential energy a body may have because of its dimension|location in external gravitational or electrostatics|electrostatic field (physics)|field, although the potential energy it has in a field due to an electrostatic induction|induced electric or magnetism|magnetic dipole moment (physics)|moment does count, as does the energy of deformation of solids (stress (physics)|stress-strain (materials science)|strain).

The principle of equipartition theorem|equipartition of energy in classical mechanics|classical statistical mechanics states that each molecular degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom receives 1/2&nbsp;''kT'' of energy, a result which was modified when quantum mechanics explained certain anomalies; e.g., in the experiment|observed specific heat capacity|specific heats of crystals (when ''h''Î½&nbsp;>&nbsp;''kT''). For monatomic helium and other noble gases, the internal energy consists only of the translation (physics)|translational kinetic energy of the individual atoms. Monatomic particles, of course, do not (sensibly) rotate or vibrate, and are not energy level|electronically excited to higher energies except at very high temperatures.

From the standpoint of statistical mechanics, the internal energy is equal to the ensemble average of the total energy of the system.
