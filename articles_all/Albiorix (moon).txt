'''Albiorix''' is a non-Sphere|spherical moon of Saturn (planet)|Saturn. It was found by Matthew J. Holman|Holman, et al. in 2000, and given the designation '''S/2000&nbsp;S&nbsp;11'''.

Albiorix is the biggest member of the Saturn's Gallic group of satellites|Gallic group of non-spherical moons.

It was named in August 2003 from one of the Celtic mythology|Celtic names for the god of tribal unity, better known as Toutatis.

Albiorix orbits Saturn at a distance of about 16,000,000 km and its diameter is estimated at 32 kilometers, assuming an albedo of 0.04. A day on Albiorix is 13 hours and 19 minutes long. 

The diagram illustrates its orbit in relation to other prograde non-Sphere|spherical moons of Saturn. The eccentricity of the orbits is represented by the yellow segments extending from the apsis|pericentre to the apsis|apocentre. 

Different colours seen recently suggest a possibility of a big crater, suggesting that Erriapo (moon)|Erriapo and Tarvos (moon)|Tarvos could be pieces of Albiorix following a near break-up collision with another body.
