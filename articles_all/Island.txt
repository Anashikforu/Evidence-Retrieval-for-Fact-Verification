An '''island''' is a piece of ground that is surrounded by a body of water such as a lake, river or sea. Islands are smaller than continents. 

Greenland and Australia are huge islands, but they are built of continental rock. The most ancient part of continental rock is far older and chemically more complex than the rock of the sea floor. 

The heart of continents is their cratons, which are the most ancient and stable parts of the Earth's crust. In the cratons are all the rare elements needed for electronic equipment. They were swept up as the Sun moved through areas where supernovae had exploded. The rare elements we need were all got indirectly from supernovae explosions. The Sun's energy  comes from turning hydrogen into helium..

There are some islands which do have rare elements, and that is a sign that they were once part of a large supercontinent. So Great Britain was once part of a supercontinent. The oldest rocks are 2,700 million years old, and include many rare elements only found in cratons.Toghill, Peter 2000. ''The geology of Britain: an introduction''. Shrewsbury: Swan Hill Press. ISBN 1-85310-890-1 Britain is a snapped-off piece of the ''Old Red Sandstone continent'', now known as Laurasia.

Other islands that were formed from the ocean floor, as Japan, and Hawaii were, lack most of the rare elements. Japan has for many years since WWII imported iron ore from Australia. Its seizing of Manchukuo (~Manchuria) and the infamous attack on Pearl Harbour no doubt had many reasons. Lack of raw materials was one of these Yamamuro, Shin'ichi. 2006.
