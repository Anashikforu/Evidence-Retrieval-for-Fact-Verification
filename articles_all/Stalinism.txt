'''Stalinism''' refers to the political system under Joseph Stalin, including ideology and state administration.  A secret history of those days is contained in the Mitrokin Archives. Stalinism involves using strong state leadership and suppression of opposition to quickly develop a country. Lazar Kaganovich, a Soviet politician, coined the term.

Stalinism existed in the Soviet Union from 1924 to 1956. The Soviet Union was an agricultural country in 1924, but by 1956 it was a powerful industrial country with good living standards. This happened because of the 5-year plans of the government. These plans contained all economic development to happen in the 5 years.

The controversial part of Stalinism is that to do all these things, the government detained or killed many people who didn't like the government. A few hundred thousand people were detained or killed. These were mostly rich people and people who wanted to go back to the Russian Empire.
