'''Latin honours''' are Latin language|Latin phrases that are used to show how advanced the Grade (education)|level at which someone earned an academic degree. The common ranks are: ''cum laude'' (meaning "with honor"), ''magna cum laude'' ("with great honor"), or ''summa cum laude'' ("with highest honor"). This system is mostly used in Canada, the United States, and in many European countries. Some universities in other countries also use the English language|English translation of these phrases rather than the Latin ones.

Another example is ''egregia cum laude'', which means "with outstanding honor" in English. The ''egregia'' rank was created to recognize students who earned the same grade point average as the ''summa'' honor, but who did so while in a more rigorous honors curriculum (used by the College of St. Benedict and St. John's University).
