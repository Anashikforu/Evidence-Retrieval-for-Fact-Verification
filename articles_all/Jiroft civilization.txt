The '''Jiroft Civilization''' () is a proposed Early Bronze Age civilization of Sistan, Iran (fl. ca. 26th century BCE|BC). It was proposed by Yousef Madjidzadeh in 2003 because of Archaeology|archaeological artifacts confiscated by Iranian authorities. White Muscarella (2005) expresses serious doubt in the accuracy of the "Jiroft Civilization" as an archaeological entity. The Jiroft site itself is of undisputed notability as a mid-3rd millennium city situated between the Elam|Elamite civilization to the west and the Indus Valley civilization to the east.
