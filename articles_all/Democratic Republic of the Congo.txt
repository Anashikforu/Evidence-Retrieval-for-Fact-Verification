It was known as Zaïre from 1971 to 1997.  It is the second largest country in Africa by area and the eleventh largest in the world.  With a population of over 71 million, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the nineteenth most populous nation in the world, the fourth most populous nation in Africa, as well as the most populous Francophone (French-speaking) country.

It is separated from Tanzania by Lake Tanganyika in the east. The country has access to the ocean through a  stretch of Atlantic coastline at Muanda and the roughly 9&nbsp;km wide mouth of the Congo River which opens into the Gulf of Guinea. It has the second-highest total Christian population in Africa.

 History

The Second Congo War, beginning in 1998, devastated the country. It involved nine African nations and some twenty armed groups.See
