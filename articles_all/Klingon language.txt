The '''Klingon language''' (''tlhIngan Hol'', ) is a language that was made for the Klingons in the ''Star Trek'' fictional universe|universe. It is a constructed language, not one that developed naturally. Only a few people can speak the Klingon language well enough to talk in it. The Klingon Language Institute helps people learn Klingon.

 History 
The first Klingon words were made by the actor James Doohan in 1979 for the Star Trek: The Motion Picture|first Star Trek movie. When they made the third movie in 1984, Gene Roddenberry wanted to have a real language for the Klingons. Marc Okrand, a linguistics|linguist (a language scientist) made the Klingon language. He has written some books about the Klingon language.

 Grammar 
Marc Okrand wanted the language to be as complicated as possible. He did this to make it sound very Extraterrestrial life|alien. The word order in a sentence is always object (grammar)|object-verb-subject (grammar)|subject. This is the opposite of English's word order, which is subject-verb-object. The english language|English sentence "I see the cat" is said as "the cat see I" in Klingon.

This language uses affixation to denote the subject and negation:


 Writing 
When writing in Klingon, some letters are always in Letter case|uppercase and some are Letter case|lowercase. This never changes because the letters are spoken differently when they are written differently.
