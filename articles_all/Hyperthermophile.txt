'''Hyperthermophiles''' are extremophileorganisms that live in an wikt:extreme|extreme environment organisms that live best in very hot environments– from 60°Centigrade|C (140°Fahrenheit|F) up to 100°C (212°F). The best temperature for hyperthermophiles to grow at is around 80°C (176°F). Hyperthermophiles are mostly in the Archaea domain (biology)|domain, but some bacteria are able to tolerate temperatures of around 100°C (212°F) as well. Many hyperthermophiles are also able to tolerate other environmental extremes, like high acidity or radiation levels.
