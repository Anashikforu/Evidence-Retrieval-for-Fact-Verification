History

In 1871, Higley moved from Indiana to Smith County, Kansas. He did this because of the Homestead Act. He lived in a small cabin near West Beaver Creek. That home is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Home on the Range Cabin.

The music was later added by Daniel E. Kelley (1808â€“1905), a carpenter and friend of Higley.

The most popular version of the song was the version recorded by Bing Crosby on September 27, 1933, with Lennie Hayton and his orchestra for Brunswick Records.

"Home on the Range" became popular in the 1930s. In fact, former president of the United States|president Franklin Delano Roosevelt said "Home on the Range" was his favorite song.
