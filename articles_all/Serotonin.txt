'''Serotonin''' is a neurotransmitter. Its chemical name is '''5-Hydroxytryptamine''' or '''5-HT'''. It is derived from tryptophan. Serotonin is found in all vertebrates, mainly in the gastrointestinal tract, blood platelets and central nervous system. Its name is derived from its effect on blood pressure: serotonin is a part of the ''serum'' which regulates the ''tonus'' of blood vessels.

Serotonin does several jobs within the human body. Unlike dopamine, serotonin causes happiness, while dopamine causes pleasure.

Serotonin is also found in insect venom, fungi and plants.

Serotonin is involved in social rank. A lobster injected with serotonin behaves like an alpha.
