The '''Association pour la Taxation des Transactions pour l'Aide aux Citoyens''' ('''Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens''', '''ATTAC''') is an organization that Promotion|promotes a tax on foreign exchange transactions, the so-called Tobin tax. 

Background

At first Attac demanded only the introduction of the so-called Tobin tax on currency speculation. Now it fights for many issues related to globalisation. Therefore, it reports about the decisions of the World Trade Organisation (World Trade Organisation|WTO), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund (International Monetary Fund|IMF).  ATTAC attends the meetings of the G8 with the goal of influencing policymakers' decisions.

Though ATTAC criticises the Neoliberalism|neoliberal ideology dominating economic globalisation, it is not "anti-globalisation".  It supports globalisation policies that they characterise as Sustainable development|sustainable and Social justice|socially just. One of ATTAC's slogans is "The World is not for sale", denouncing the "merchandisation" of society.
