A '''chassis''' (plural chassis) consists of a framework that supports an inanimate (non-life|living) object. This is much like an animal's skeleton, for example in a car.

 Examples of use 
In a car, the term chassis means the Frame (vehicle)|frame (the metal "skeleton") plus the engine, transmission (gear shift), driveshaft, differential (gears which keep the back wheels moving correctly), and suspension (springs which keep the car above the ground). A body, which is usually not necessary to keep the car together, is built on top of the chassis to complete the car.

A tank (war machine)'s chassis (hull) comprises the bottom part of the tank, which includes the tracks, power plant, driver's seat, and crew compartment.

A chassis in a television, radio, or other electricity|electronic device consists of the metal frame on which the circuit boards and other electronics are mounted. Sometimes the chassis refers to the parts themselves.

In computers, the chassis refers to the rigid framework onto which the motherboard, computer storage|memory, disk drives, and other equipment are mounted. It also supports the shell-like ''case'': the housing that protects all of the vital internal equipment from dust, moisture, and tampering. The term "case modding" refers to the artistic styling of otherwise rather functional and plain computer encasings.
