'''Cloth''', '''textile''' or '''fabric''' are similar names for manufactured material. They are often made by weaving or knitting fibres together. It is often used to make clothing or cover furniture.

Cloth can be made from natural fibres or man-made ones. Examples of natural fibres are cotton, wool, and silk.  Examples of man-made fibres are nylon, rayon, and polyester.

 History 
The first clothes, were worn at least 70,000 years ago and maybe much earlier. They were probably made of animal Skin|skins and helped to protect early Human|humans from the weather. At some point, people learned to weave plant Fibre|fibers into textiles.

 Uses 
Textiles are commonly used for clothing. They are also Container|containers such as Bag|bags and Basket|baskets. In the household, textiles are used in Carpet|carpeting, upholstered Furniture|furnishings, Window shade|window shades, Towel|towels, coverings for Table (furniture)|tables, Bed|beds, and other flat Surface|surfaces. Textiles are also used in art. In the workplace, textiles can be used in industrial and scientific Process|processes such as filtering. It can also be used in Flag|flags, Backpack|backpacks, Tent|tents, Net|nets, Handkerchief|handkerchiefs, cleaning rags. It is used in transportation devices such as Balloon|balloons, Kite|kites, Sail|sails, and Parachute|parachutes. Textiles are also used make Composite material|composite materials such as fibreglass and industrial Geotextile|geotextiles stronger. Textiles are used in many traditional Craft|crafts such as sewing, quilting and embroidery.

 Types and sources of fibre 
Textiles are made from many materials. The fibre used in textiles are gotten from with four main sources. They are animal (wool, silk), plant (cotton, flax, jute, bamboo), mineral (asbestos, glass fibre), and Synthetic material|synthetic (nylon, polyester, Acryl|acrylic, rayon). The first three are natural.

= Animal =
There are many sources of animal fibers. They include:

 '''Wool''' refers to the hair of the domestic sheep or goat. It is different from other types of animal hair because each strand is coated with Scale|scales and lanolin. Wool is commonly used for thick clothing. Examples include:
 '''''Alpaca wool''''', '''''vicuña wool''''', '''''llama wool''''', and '''''camel hair'''''. They are generally used to make Coat|coats, Jacket|jackets, Poncho|ponchos, Blanket|blankets, and other warm coverings.
 '''''Cashmere wool|Cashmere''''', the hair of the Indian cashmere goat, and mohair, the hair of the North African angora goat, are types of wool that are known for their softness.
 '''''Angora wool|Angora''''' refers to the long, thick, soft hair of the angora rabbit.
 Qiviut is the fine inner wool of the Musk ox|muskox.
 '''Sea silk''' is an extremely fine, rare, and valuable fabric. It is made from the silky Filament|filaments or byssus secreted by a gland in the foot of Pinnidae|pen shells.
 '''Silk''' is an animal textile made from the Fibre|fibres of the cocoon of the Chinese silkworm. It is spun into a smooth fabric which is soft. Around four-fifths of the silk made is made up of cultivated silk.

=Plant=
There are many sources of plant fibers. They include:

 Coir (coconut fibre) is used in making twine. It is also used in making Doormat|doormats, Brush|brushes, Mattress|mattresses, floor Tile|tiles, and Bag|bags.
 '''Straw''' and '''bamboo''' are both used to make hats. Straw is a dried form of grass. It is also used for stuffing, as is kapok.
 Fibres from '''pulpwood trees''', cotton, rice, hemp, and nettle are used in making paper.
 '''Cotton''', '''flax''', '''jute''', '''hemp''', '''modal''' and even '''bamboo fibre''' are all used in clothing. Piña (pineapple fibre) and ramie are also fibres used in clothing.
 '''Acetate''' is used to make certain fabrics such as silks, Velvet|velvets, and Taffeta|taffetas shinier.
 '''Seaweed''' is used in making textiles.
 '''Rayon''' is a fabric gotten from plant pulp.

=Mineral=
There are three sources of mineral fibers. They include:

 '''Asbestos''' and '''Basalt fiber|basalt fibre''' are mineral fibres used for vinyl tiles, sheeting and Adhesive|adhesives, acoustical ceilings, Stage (theatre)|stage Curtain|curtains, and Fire blanket|fire blankets.
 '''Glass fiber|Glass fibre''' is used in making ironing board and mattress covers, Rope|ropes and Cable|cables, reinforcement fibre for Composite material|composite materials, insect netting, Flame retardant|flame-retardant and protective fabric, Soundproofing|soundproof, Fireproofing|fireproof, and Insulation|insulating fibres.
 '''Metal fibre''', '''metal foil''', and '''metal wire''' have lots of uses including making cloth-of-gold and jewellery.

=Synthetic=
There are many sources synthetic fibres. They include

 '''Polyester''' fibre is used in all types of clothing, either alone or used together with fibres such as cotton.
 '''Aramid''' fibre (e.g. Twaron) is used for flame-retardant clothing, cut-protection, and armour.
 '''Acrylic fiber|Acrylic''' is a fibre used to mimic wools. It is often used to replace wool in some clothes.
 '''Nylon''' is a fibre used to mimic silk. It is used in making pantyhose. Thicker nylon fibres are used in rope.
 '''Spandex''' is a polyurethane product. It is used to make activewear, Brassière|bras, and Swimsuit|swimsuits.
 '''Olefin fibre''' is a fibre used in activewear, Lining|linings, and warm clothing. Olefins are hydrophobic, which allows them to dry quickly.
 '''Ingeo''' is a polylactide fibre mixed with other fibres such as cotton and used in clothing. It is hydrophilic.
 '''Lurex''' is a metallic fibre used in clothing embellishment.
 '''Milk''' Protein|proteins have also been used to make synthetic fabric. It is sold as a biodegradable, renewable synthetic fibre.
 '''Carbon fiber|Carbon fibre''' is mostly used in Composite material|composite materials, together with resin. The fibres are made from polymer fibres through carbonization.
