The '''Swiss Grand Prix''' () was the Auto racing|motor race of Switzerland. In its later years it was a Formula One race.

Grand Prix racing started in Switzerland in 1934. The Circuit Bremgarten|Bremgarten circuit was just outside the town of Bremgarten bei Bern|Bremgarten, near Bern (city)|Bern. The Swiss Grand Prix counted toward the European Championship from 1935 to 1939.

The Bremgarten track remained the home of the Swiss Grand Prix until 1954. In 1958, motor racing was banned by the Swiss government as an unsafe spectator sport. The was in reaction following the death of 80 people at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans race. The Swiss Grand Prix did return for two more races, but at the Dijon-Prenois circuit, just across the border in France. In 1975 it was a non-Championship Grand Prix. One Championship F1 race was held in 1982.
