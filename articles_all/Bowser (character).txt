Bowser's first appearance was in ''Super Mario Bros.'' as a final boss to Mario. The first seven castles in the game had Bowsers, but they only looked like him and were actually his minions, who were disguised as him. Only the eighth Bowser is really him.

Bowser's kids, called the Koopalings, were bosses in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', ''Super Mario World'', ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'', ''New Super Mario Bros. 2'', and ''New Super Mario Bros. U''. However, after ''Super Mario World,'' The Koopalings were no longer Bowser's biological kids, since they are now adopted children and Bowser Jr. is now his biological child. In ''Super Mario World'', Bowser appears in a clown car and throws Mecha Koopas.

When Mario moved to the Nintendo 64 with ''Super Mario 64'', Bowser was again the main bad guy. In the remake of this game, Super Mario 64 DS, he is fought as a boss three times.

He also appears in the Disney movie ''Wreck-It Ralph''.
