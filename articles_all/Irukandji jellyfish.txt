The '''Irukandji Jellyfish''', ''Carukia barnesi'', is a species of jellyfish. It lives in the waters of northern Australia. It is a very deadly jellyfish. The Irukandji is only 2.5 centimeters (with bell and tentacles) in diameter. The Irukandji is believed to be the most poisonous creature in the world. Some people are not sure if that is true.

The Irukandjis' name comes from an Australian Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal tribe. The tribe lived in the Palm Cove, Queensland|Palm Cove region of North Queensland. When the Irukandji people were stung by the Irukandji, there are many symptoms. This includes:
 lower back pain
 muscle cramps
 vomiting
 restlessness
 anxiety

Sometimes, people may also get fluid on their lungs (pulmonary oedema), hypertension, and heart  failure.

The Irukandji has killed at least two swimmers in Australia. In 2002, Richard Jordon came to Australia as a tourist. He was a 58 year old Britain|British man. He was stung while swimming off Hamilton Island. Jordon died a few days later. There may have been more deaths which Medical doctor|doctors did not know were caused by the jellyfish.

The Irukandji is related to another jellyfish. This is the box jellyfish, ''Chironex Fleckeri''.

Irukandji has stingers â€“ not only on its tentacles, but also on its bell. It is very small and weak. Because of this, sudden force may kill it. So, it cannot be kept in a normal aquarium. The first Irukandji jellyfish in captivity (animal)|captivity was birth|born in Townsville, Queensland.
