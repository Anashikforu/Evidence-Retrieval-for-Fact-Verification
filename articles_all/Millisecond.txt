A '''millisecond''' (sometimes shortened to 'ms')  is one thousandth of a second. To help you understand how fast a milisecond is, try 
One millisecond contains 1000 microseconds. There are 1000 milliseconds in one second.

 1 millisecond – the time it takes for a normal flash (photo)|flash in a camera to finish.
 1 millisecond – time taken for sound to travel 34 Centimeter|cm
 1.000692286 milliseconds – time taken for light to travel 300&nbsp;km in a vacuum
 2 milliseconds – Half-life (element)|half life of hassium-265
 3 milliseconds – a housefly’s wing flap
 3.4 milliseconds – half life of meitnerium-266
 5 milliseconds – a honeybee’s wing flap
 8 milliseconds – 1/125 of a second (125), a camera shutter speed
 9 milliseconds – normal seek time for a 7200rpm hard disk
 33.3 milliseconds  -  the amount of time one frame lasts in 30fps video
 30 to 100 milliseconds  -  normal lag|latency for a broadband internet connection
 100 milliseconds  -  the reaction speed of a human
 102 milliseconds  -  Half-life (element)|half-life of bohrium-262
 134 milliseconds  -  the amount of time it takes by light to travel around the earth's equator
