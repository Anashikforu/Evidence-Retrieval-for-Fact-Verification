'''Conficker''' (also known as '''Downup''', '''Downadup''' and '''Kido''') is a computer worm that first showed up in October 2008. It targeted the Microsoft Windows operating system.

Conficker was believed to be the worst computer worm since the SQL slammer worm in 2003.

On 13 February 2009, Microsoft offered a $250,000 USD reward for help with finding and arresting the people who created the computer worm.
