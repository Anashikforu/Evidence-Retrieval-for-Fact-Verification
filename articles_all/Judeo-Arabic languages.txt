'''Judeo-Arabic languages''' are a collection of Arabic language dialect|dialects spoken by Jew|Jews living or formerly living in Arabic-speaking country|countries.  Just as with the rest of the Arab world, Arabic-speaking Jews had different dialects for the different regions where they lived.  Most Jud√¶o-Arabic dialects were written in modified forms of the Hebrew alphabet, often including consonant dots from the Arabic alphabet to accommodate phonemes that did not exist in the Hebrew alphabet.

In retaliation for 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jews in Arab countries became subject to increasingly insufferable discrimination and violence, causing virtually all of them to flee en masse to Israel.  Their dialects of Arabic did not thrive in Israel, and most became extinct, replaced by the Modern Hebrew language.

In the Middle Ages, Jews in the Islamic diaspora spoke a dialect of Arabic language|Arabic, which they wrote in a mildly adapted Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew script  (rather than using Arabic alphabet|Arabic script).

This phenomenon is called '''Judaeo-Arabic''' and may be compared to both Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish) and Yiddish (Judaeo-German).

Some of the most important books of medieval Jewish though were originally written in Judaeo-Arabic, as well as certain halakhic works and biblical commentary.  Only later were they translated into medieval scientific Hebrew so that they could be read by the Ashkenazic Jews of Europe.  These include:

 Saadia Gaon's ''Emunot ve-Deot'', his ''Tafsir'' (biblical commentary and translation), and his ''siddur'' (the explanatory parts, not the prayers themselves)
 Solomon ibn Gabirol's ''Tikkun Middot ha-Nefesh''
 Bahya ibn Pakuda's ''Hovot ha-Levavot''
 Judah Halevi's ''Kuzari''
 Maimonides' ''Commentary on the Mishnah'', ''Sefer ha-Mitzvot'', ''Guide to the Perplexed'', and many of his letters and shorter essays.
