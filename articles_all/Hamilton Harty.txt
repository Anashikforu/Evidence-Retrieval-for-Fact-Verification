When he was twelve he was organist at Magheracoll Church, County Antrim.  He also had organist jobs at Belfast and Dublin.

For her he wrote a piece for soprano and orchestra called ''Ode to a Nightingale''.

He soon became known as a conductor, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra and, from 1920, The Hallé, which he made into one of the best orchestras in England.
He conducted works by many composers, some of whom were little known at the time: they included Bax, Sibelius, Berlioz, Moeran, William Walton|Walton and Richard Strauss.  He gave the first performance in England of Mahler’s Ninth Symphony.
