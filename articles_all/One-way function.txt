In cryptography, a '''one-way function''' is a function (mathematics)|function that is very simple to compute (figure out) in one direction. There is a series of instructions that can be simply and easily applied to an input to give a complicated output. However the reverse of going from the output to the input is made to be as difficult as possible.
