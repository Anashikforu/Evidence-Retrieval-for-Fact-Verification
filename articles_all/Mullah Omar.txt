Mullah '''Mohammed Omar''' (1959 - 23 April 2013) was the leader of the Taliban in Afghanistan. He was usually called '''Mullah Omar'''. Between 1996 and 2001, he was Afghanistan's de facto head of state. Three states officially recognised him under the title of 'Head of the Supreme Council'. He was born in 1959 in Kandahar Province of Afghanistan.Rashid, ''Taliban'', (2001) p.23 He held the title Amir al-Mu'minin|Commander of the Faithful from the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

The United States put him on their most wanted list. They believe he sheltered Osama bin Laden, and some of his al-Quaeda group, directly before and after they committed the September 11 attacks. He was believed to be directing the Taliban in their War in Afghanistan (2001â€“present)|war against Hamid Karzai|Hamid Karzai's Government and foreign NATO troops in Afghanistan from Pakistan.
Despite his political rank, and his high status on the FBI's wanted list,

Omar's right eye was missing as the result of a war wound. People described him as being tall.Griffiths, John, C. "Afghanistan: A History of Conflict", 1981. Second Revision 2001.Christian Science Monitor, 
When he was Emir of Afghanistan, Omar stayed in Kandahar most of the time and rarely met outsiders. He sent his Foreign Minister, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, to represent him, on most occasions.

News media claimed that he was killed by a Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone strike in 2008.
In 2012, it was revealed that an individual claiming to be Omar sent a letter to President of the United States|President Barack Obama in 2011, expressing slight interest in peace talks.

Death
On 29 July 2015, the Afghan government and state intelligence sources said that Omar had died in April 2013 two years previously in Karachi, Pakistan, of tuberculosis. Some Taliban sources denied that he had died; other sources considered the report to be speculative, designed to destabilise peace negotiations in Pakistan between the Afghan government and the Taliban. A Taliban spokesman said that they would issue a statement.

It was later learned that he died in Afghanistan, not Pakistan.
