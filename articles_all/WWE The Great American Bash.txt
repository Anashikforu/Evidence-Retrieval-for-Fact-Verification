'''The Great American Bash''' is an yearly summer professional wrestling pay-per-view made by World Wrestling Entertainment. It was originally made by the National Wrestling Alliance and then by World Championship Wrestling. However, according to Ric Flair in his autobiography, Dusty Rhodes invented The Great American Bash.
 
After the last Great American Bash by World Championship Wrestling in 2000, The Great American Bash did not happen again until 2004 and only WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|Smackdown! superstars were on it until the 2007 event when WWE Raw|Raw and Extreme Championship Wrestling (WWE)|ECW superstars joined. Something special about this pay-per-view is that anyone in the American military can see The Great American Bash for free.
