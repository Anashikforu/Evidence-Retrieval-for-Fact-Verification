"'''Du gamla, du fria'''" (International Phonetic Alphabet|pron. dʉː ˈɡâmːla dʉː ˈfrîːa "doo GAHM-lah doo FREE-ah"; English language|en. 'Thou ancient, thou free'), originally titled "'''Sång till Norden'''" ('Song to the North'), is the Swedish language|Swedish title and incipit of a 19th-century patriotic song which serves as the ''de facto'' national anthem of Sweden – it is therefore unofficial. The lyrics (words) were written by Swedes|Swedish jurist and antiquarian Richard Dybeck in 1844, and its melody is based on a traditional folk tune which was later rearranged by Swedish composer and librarian Edvin Kallstenius nearly a century later.
Unlike Norway's national anthem, "Ja, vi elsker dette landet", the Swedish anthem has not been made official yet—the Constitution of Sweden|Swedish constitution has yet to mention a national anthem.
