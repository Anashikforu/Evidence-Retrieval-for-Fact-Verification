'''Therizinosaurs''' The name ''therizinosaur'' is derived from the Ancient Greek|Greek ''therizo'' meaning 'to reap' or 'to cut off' and ''sauros'' meaning 'lizard'. The older name ''segnosaur'' is derived from Latin ''segnis'' meaning 'slow' or 'sluggish' and Ancient Greek|Greek ''sauros'' meaning 'lizard'. (or '''segnosaurs''') are  a clade of Theropoda|theropod dinosaurs which appear to be herbivorous. 

Therizinosaur fossils have been found in Cretaceous deposits in Mongolia, the People's Republic of China and Western North America. Various features of the forelimbs, skull and pelvis show they are theropods and maniraptorans, close relatives to birds.

History
Early finds were incomplete, and showed strange anatomy with features typical of theropods, prosauropods and ornithischians. This led some scientists to think that segnosaurs were a late-surviving suborder of primitive dinosaurs.Paul G.S. 1988. ''Predatory dinosaurs of the world: a complete illustrated guide''. New York: Simon and Schuster. p464  

It was not until the mid-1990s, that their true identity as herbivorous descendants of the carnivorous theropods became generally accepted. ''Alxasaurus'' was discovered, and had more typical theropod features; and ''Therizinosaurus'' was recognized as a member of the segnosaur group. 

The connection between the therizinosaurids and other theropods was made clear when primitive members of the group, such as ''Beipiaosaurus'' (1999) and ''Falcarius'' (2005) were discovered. 

Although they are now classified as theropods, therizinosaurs had skulls similar to those of sauropoda|sauropods and the shape of their teeth and jaws do make it likely that they were herbivores.
