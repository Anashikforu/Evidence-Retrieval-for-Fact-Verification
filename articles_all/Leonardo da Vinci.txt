The Biblioteca Ambrosiana (a library) in Milan has the twelve-volume ''Codex Atlanticus''.

 The geology of the Earth, with its mountains, valleys, rivers and Rock (geology)|rocks.
 The anatomy of the human body with its skeleton, muscles, veins and digestive system|internal organs. Leonardo was given dead bodies by a hospital. He "dissected" (cut up) thirty dead bodies and carefully drew many of the parts. His drawings of bones and muscles were to help other artists to paint the human body properly.

Many of the drawings and notes in Leonardo's notebooks are designs, plans and inventions.

Some of the things that Leonardo designed are: 
 Costumes for parades, carnivals and theatre. These were probably for Duke Federico's court. They include armour, and a ferocious dragon.
 War machines such as an armour-plated tank, an enormous archery|cross bow and a horrible horse-driven leg-chopper. None of these things were ever made in Leonardo's lifetime.
 Dams and canals for rivers.
 A wooden bridge that could be carried flat on wagons and unfolded and put together at the river.
 Flying things with wings that flapped, a helicopter, a parachute and a glider|hang glider. One of Leonardo's servants was injured, trying out the hang glider. The parachute has been made and tested in modern times, and it does work.
 Church (building) and castles. It is possible that the Castle of Locarno, in the south of Switzerland was designed by Leonardo.
