In object-oriented programming, a '''method''' is a part of an Object (computer science)|object. A method allows the object to perform an action, whether this action is to modify itself or to return a value. An example is:


public int getOne() {
    return 1;
}


This syntax is the same in different programming languages such as Java (programming language)|Java and C Sharp (programming language)|C#.

The public identifier means that this method is publicly accessible, that anyone is allowed to use this. In comparison, a method may be private or sometimes protected, the latter of which means only specific parts of the same program are allowed to use this method, and never a human user. A privately accessible method only allows the object it belongs to, to edit it. This is used to give data security.

The int identifier means that the return|return type is an integer value.
