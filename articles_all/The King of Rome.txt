 The song 



Dave Sudbury wrote a song about ''The King of Rome''. The song is also about Charlie Hudson. It says that "On the day of the big race a storm blew in. A thousand birds were swept away and never seen again",. That shows how dangerous birds races can be.

The song was recorded by June Tabor.  She heard Sudbury sing the song at a competition. The competition was in the late 1980s. She was a judge at the competition. Sudbury came fourth.Sleeve notes, Iain MacKintosh & Brian McNeill, ''Live and Kicking'', 2000 Tabor also recorded the song. She recorded it for an album called ''Aqaba (album)|Aqaba''. Aqaba was released in 1988.

Brian McNeill was another finalist at the competition. He said:

The King of Rome was head and shoulders above every other song sung on the night, and should have won.

McNeill also sang the song. A live recording is on ''Live and Kicking''. That is a record McNeil made in 2000. He recorded it with Iain MacKintosh.

The band Half Man Half Biscuit also played the song. But they never put it on one of their records.
