A '''mach number''' is a number that describes speed. It is a measure of the speed of an object compared to the speed of sound. Mach number is given as a percentage compared to the local speed of sound. For example, half the speed of sound = Mach 0.5.

M=v/a 

Where '''v''' is the speed of the object, and '''a''' is the speed of sound.
: \mathrm{M} = \frac{u}{c},

It is named after the Austrian physicist Ernst Mach. When writing a speed as a Mach number, the number comes after "Mach." For example, the Concorde airplane could fly at Mach 2, and a satellite re-enters the Earth's atmosphere at about Mach 25.Bodie, Warren M., ''The Lockheed P-38 Lightning'', Widewing Publications .
