'''Animal Collective''' is a band originally from Baltimore, Maryland, but are now based in New York City. Animal Collective consists of Avey Tare (David Portner), Panda Bear (Noah Lennox), Deakin, also spelled as Deacon or Deaken (Josh Dibb), and Geologist (Brian Weitz).

Members
 '''Avey Tare''' (David Portner; vocals, guitar, samples, keyboard instruments, percussion) – Name comes from "tearing" apart the name David to make Avey Tare.
 '''Deakin''' (Josh Dibb; synthesizer, guitar, vocals) – Name comes from letters he used to write to other members under the name Conrad Deacon. He has used different spellings of the name on different albums: Having been absent from the band's tours since early 2007, he began a solo tour in 2010 (using the spelling "Deakin" at the request of fellow Baltimorean musician Dan Deacon, in order to avoid confusion.)
 '''Geologist''' (Brian Weitz; electronics, samples, vocals) – Name comes from the headlamp he wears in order to see the electronics during live shows.Explained on WNYC's "Spinning On Air," July 30, 2004, second hour. Someone mistakenly thought Brian studied geology in college; however, he studied marine biology.
 '''Panda Bear''' (Noah Lennox; vocals, percussion, samples, guitar) – Name comes from the panda he drew on the first set of songs he ever wrote.
