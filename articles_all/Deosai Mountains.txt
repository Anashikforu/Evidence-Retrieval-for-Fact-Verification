'''Deosai Mountains''' are between the Vale of Kashmir, Gilgit Agency and Baltistan District. There is also a large plain with an area of 580 sq miles, with the same name Deosai. The whole area is uninhabited, surrounded by rocky mountains, at an elevation of 16,000 to 17,000 feet. The road leading to Skardu from Gurez passes through the Deosai Plains. Tragbal Pass and Burzil Pass, in this area, connect the Valley of Kashmir with Baltistan and Gilgit.
