'''Asphalt''', or '''bitumen''',  is a sticky, black and highly Viscosity|viscous liquid or semi-solid, composed almost entirely of petroleum.Holleran, Glynn and Jeffrey Reed. 
Its main use is in road construction. Mixed with "aggregate" (sand, gravel, crushed stone, etc.) it makes a good road surface. It has various other names: pitch, tarmac, blacktop, asphalt concrete, asphalt pavement (US), all mean roughly the same thing.

Asphalt which is liquid is often called tar. Tar is also used for plant resin. Solid asphalt is often called pitch (resin)|pitch. 

Although  a block of asphalt or pitch can look like a solid, it still flows, but very slowly. There have been a few "pitch experiments" to see how long it takes for a drip to form and drop off a block of apparently solid pitch.
