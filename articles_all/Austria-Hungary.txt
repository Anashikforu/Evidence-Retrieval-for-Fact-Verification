It was an empire made up of many different peoples and great power. It found its political life full of arguments between the eleven main national groups.

 Creation of Austria–Hungary 

The ''Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Ausgleich'' or compromise of February 1867 created the Empire's dualist structure. The Austrian Empire (1804–67) had lessened in strength and in power. This was because of the Austro–Sardinian War of 1859 and the Austro–Prussian War of 1866. Also, the Hungarian people were not happy with how Vienna treated them. This had been going on for many years and it led to Hungarian separation. This included the Hungarian liberal revolution of 1848–49.

Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph tried to reach an agreement with the Hungarian nobility. He needed their support to keep the empire together. The Hungarian nobility would not accept anything less than equality between themselves and the Austrian elites.

 Governmental structure 
Hungary and Austria had different parliaments. Each had its own prime minister. The monarch kept the two working together. He had Absolute monarchy|absolute power in theory but very little in reality. The monarch’s central government had charge of the army, navy, foreign policy, and the customs union.

 World War I 

The deaths of Franz Joseph's brother, Maximilian I of Mexico (1867), and his only son, Crown Prince Rudolf, made the Emperor's nephew, Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria|Franz Ferdinand, next in line to the crown. On 28 June, 1914, the heir visited the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. Bosnian Serbia|Serb militants of the group Mlada Bosna :wikt:attack|attacked Franz Ferdinand's motorcade and assassinated him.

Some members of the government, such as Conrad von Hötzendorf had wanted to fight the Serbian nation for many years. The leaders of Austria-Hungary decided to attack Serbia before it could start a revolt. They used the assassination as an excuse. They gave Serbia a list of ten demands called the July Ultimatum. They expected Serbia would not accept. Serbia accepted nine of the ten demands but only partially accepted the other one. Austria-Hungary declared war.

These events brought the Empire into conflict with Serbia. Russia moved its army to help Serbia. This set off troop movements on both sides and started World War I.

 End of the Empire 

Near the end of the war, it was understood that the allied powers would win. Part of the empire started declaring independence from the monarch. They formed their own countries.

The following countries were formed from the former Habsburg lands:
 Austria
 Hungary
 Czechoslovakia
 Yugoslavia| Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes(with Serbia and Montenegro)
 Poland(with lands from Russian Empire|Russian and German empire|German empires.

Some Austro-Hungarian lands were also given to Romania and Italy.
