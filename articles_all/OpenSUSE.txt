'''openSUSE''' () is a community project, sponsored by Novell and AMD,  The initial release was a beta version of SUSE Linux 10.0, and as of Janury 2016 the current stable release is openSUSE Leap 42.1

 System requirements 

OpenSUSE 11.1 has full support for 32-bit i586 and 64-bit x86-64 Personal computer|PC hardware, as well as PowerPC (PPC) processors. The basic requirements for non-PPC hardware is as follows:
 CPU: Intel—Pentium 1-4 or Xeon; AMD—Duron, Athlon, Athlon XP, Athlon MP, Athlon 64, Sempron or Opteron
 RAM: 256 MB minimum, 512 MB recommended
 Hard drive: 500 MB for minimal system; 3 GB recommended for standard system

Older processors that still belong to the i586 family can be used, for example the AMD K6|AMD K6/2. When extra language/translation files and documentation are removed and X is not needed, decent console-based router systems can be made using 300 MB disk space. Most console workloads also cope with 128 MB of RAM at the cost of increased swap activity in tight situations.
