A '''landfill''' is a place where waste is kept. Waste is usually burial|buried in landfills, but it may first be sorted to remove any Recycling|recyclable materials.

Landfills have a bad odor|smell and look bad, therefore are usually located far away from where people live. 

Once the waste is crushed into very small pieces, it is buried, but without oxygen, a dangerous gas called methane is created. This process is called anaerobic digestion. In some countries, the methane from landfills is used to generate energy.
