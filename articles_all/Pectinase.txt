A '''pectinase''' is one of a class of enzymes which are able to split pectin. Pectin is a polysaccharide in the primary cell walls of terrestrial plants. Pectinases occur normally in flowering plants. 

Pectinases are used commercially to isolate the protoplasts that occur in plants. They are also used in the production of fruit juice, for plant-based food coloring|coloring agents, and in the production of wine.
