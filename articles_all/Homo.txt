'''''Homo''''' is a genus of upright primates that Bipedalism|walk on two legs. The only living species is ''Homo sapiens'' (humans).

The genus began about 2.3 million years ago. Their ancestors were almost certainly some line of Australopithecine apes. Species of ''Homo'' have:
#A larger brain (above 900ml)
#Improved walking and running ability. 

As the process continues, the forehead becomes more vertical, the skull becomes rounder, the teeth are reduced in size, arms are shorter and legs are longer. The skeleton becomes more delicate. particularly in our species. 

All species used stone tools, but there is no evidence of when language developed. Human evolution is a much studied topic.Alexander, Richard D. 1990. ''How did humans evolve?
