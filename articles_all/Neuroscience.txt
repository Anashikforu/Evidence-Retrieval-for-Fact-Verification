'''Neuroscience''' (or neurobiology) is the scientific study of the nervous system. It is the branch of biology which investigates every aspect of the brain and nervous system.

The nervous system is made of billions of neurons connected together and to other systems in the body.  The central nervous system includes the brain, spinal cord and retina. It is connected to the rest of the body via the peripheral nervous system.
