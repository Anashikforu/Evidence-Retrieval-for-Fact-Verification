Gameplay
In the ''Mario Kart'' series, players compete in Kart racing|go-kart races, controlling one of a selection of characters from the ''Mario (series)|Mario'' franchise. Up to eight participants can compete in each race, with the exception of ''Mario Kart Wii'', which holds twelve. One of the features of the series is the use of various power-up items obtained by driving into item boxes laid out on the course. These power-ups include mushrooms to give players a speed boost, Koopa Troopa|Koopa Shells to be thrown at opponents, and banana peels that can be laid on the track as hazards. The type of weapon received from an item box is random and often influenced by the player's position in the race. For example, players lagging far behind may receive more powerful items while the leader will only receive small defensive items. This gameplay mechanic–called "rubber banding"– allows other players or computers a realistic chance to catch up to the leading player no matter how far ahead they are. As the series has progresses, each new title has introduced new elements in order to keep the gameplay fresh. Changes typically include new items, new stages, and new methods of obtaining speed boosts, but most games have also featured a new play mechanic as well. Changes new titles have brought to the series include: ''Mario Kart 64'' introducing 4-player racing and bringing the series into the third dimension, ''Mario Kart: Double Dash!!'s'' introducing a partner system and the Double Dash!!, ''Mario Kart Wii's'' use of motorbikes and twelve participants per race, and the newest entry into the franchise, ''Mario Kart 7'', featuring hang gliders, submarines and a new First-person (video games)|first-person perspective as well as customizing karts.

=Courses=
Many course themes are repeated throughout the series. For example, most games have featured a circuit course, a desert course, a city or highway course with traffic, some form of a beach course, a stadium course, a jungle course, an ice or snow course, Bowser (character)|Bowser's Castle and Rainbow Road. Each game in the series includes 16 original courses, with the exception of ''Super Mario Kart'' and ''Super Circuit'', which holds 20. Most races have three laps, while some games have more or less. There are also three to six original battle arenas in each game, designed exclusively for Battle mode. So far, there are 120 original courses and 30 original arenas spread throughout these seven games. Additionally, there are 48 Retro courses and 10 Retro arenas. These consist of older material recreated for newer games.

=Modes of play=
Each ''Mario Kart'' game features a variety of different modes. The following modes recur most often in the series:

'''Grand Prix''' – players compete in various "cups," groups of several courses each. Players earn points according to their finishing position in each race, and the player with the most points at the end of the cup wins a trophy. In some games, a ranking system is also included to determine the player's overall performance.
'''Time Trial''' – (single player) the player attempts to complete any course in the fastest time possible with three mushrooms to be used at anytime during the run. The best time is then saved as a Ghost (video gaming)|ghost, in which the player can compete against in later runs.
'''VS''' – multiple human players compete against each other on any course with custom rules. Also playable in single player mode since ''Mario Kart DS''.
'''Battle''' – players use race items to battle each other in a closed arena. Each player starts the battle with three balloons and loses a balloon with every hit sustained; the last player possessing at least one balloon wins the match. In later installments, other battles have been added including throwing Bob-ombs at opponents, collecting Shine Sprites (an object found in ''Super Mario Sunshine'') and coins. In ''Mario Kart Wii'' and ''Mario Kart 7'', the battles have a time limit. Since ''Mario Kart DS'', battle mode is playable in both single and multiplayer.
