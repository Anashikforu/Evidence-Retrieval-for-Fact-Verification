The '''Sphenodontia''' is a diverse group of reptile. It includes only one living genus, the tuatara (''Sphenodon''). An alternative name for the order is the '''Rhynchocephalia'''. 

They are an offshoot from the  evolutionary  line leading to the true lizards and snakes. They had many families during the late  Triassic and  Jurassic periods but then declined, and are the least successful of the lepidosaurs.Evans S.E. & Jones M.E.H. 2010.

The only surviving member today is the New Zealand tuatara.
