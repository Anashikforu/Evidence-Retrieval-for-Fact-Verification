A '''hapax legomenon''' is a word that is only occurs once in a Corpus (linguistics)|corpus of text.  The plural is either ''hapax legomena'', or ''hapaxes''. The word comes from Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek, and means'' (something) only said once''.

In this context, a word that occurs twice is called  '''''dis legomenon''''' ().

''Hapax legomena'' are quite common, as predicted by Zipf's law,Paul Baker, Andrew Hardie, and Tony McEnery, ''A Glossary of Corpus Linguistics'', Edinburgh University Press, 2006, page 81, , p. 87.

Note that ''hapax legomenon'' refers to a word's appearance in a body of text, and does not talk about its origin nor how often it is used in speech.  For this reason, it is different from a nonce word, which may never be recorded, or which may find currency and may be widely recorded, or which may appear several times in the work which coins it, and so on.
