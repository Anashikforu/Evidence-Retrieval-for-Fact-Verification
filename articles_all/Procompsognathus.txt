'''''Procompsognathus''''' was a small, speedy theropod dinosaur. This meat-eater lived during the late Triassic period, about 210 million years ago (mya). It probably ate insects and lizards in a relatively dry, inland environment.Frances Freedman & Tony Gibbons 1997. ''Looking at Procompsognathus: a dinosaur from the Triassic period''. Gareth Stevens, 24. 

''Procompsognathus'' may have been about one meter long (3.3&nbsp;ft),Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2011) ''Dinosaurs: the most complete, up-to-date encyclopedia for dinosaur lovers of all ages''. 
A biped, ''Procompsognathus'' had long hind legs, short arms, large clawed hands, a long slender snout with many small teeth, and a stiff tail. The tibia is approximately 20% longer than the femur in ''Procompsognathus''. This suggests that they were good runners.Coombs W.P Jr. 1978. Theoretical aspects of cursorial adaptations in dinosaurs.'' The Quarterly Review of Biology'' '''53''':393â€“418.
