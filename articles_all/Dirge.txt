A '''dirge''' is a sorrow|sad song or poem of unhappiness. They are usually sung at funerals. It is likely that ''dirge'' also came from the old expression ''Dirige, Domine, Deus meus, in conspectu tuo viam meam'' ("Direct my way in your sight, O Lord my God"). "Dirge", meaning ''to direct'', is the same as a "dirigible" ("steerable") airship. These two words became connected in 1937 because of the Hindenburg disaster.
