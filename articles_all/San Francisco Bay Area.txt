The City and County of San Francisco is generally placed in a category by itself in terms of geography and culture. It is separated by water from the north, west and east, and by a county line from its neighbor cities to the South. San Francisco has been the cultural, financial and urban center of the region for a long time.  For most of the Bay Area's history, it has also been the main population center.  But because the size of the county is limited, the growth of the city was limited as well. As a result, other cities and counties have had more population growth.

The area between the South Bay and the City and County of San Francisco is the San Francisco Peninsula, known locally as ''The Peninsula''. This area includes many small cities and suburban communities in San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County and the northwestern part of Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County, as well as several towns along the Pacific Ocean|Pacific coast, such as Pacifica, California|Pacifica and Half Moon Bay, California|Half Moon Bay.

= East Bay =

The East Bay is split into two regions, the inner East Bay, which is on the coast of the Bay, and the outer East Bay, including the inland valleys separated from the inner East Bay by hills and mountains.
