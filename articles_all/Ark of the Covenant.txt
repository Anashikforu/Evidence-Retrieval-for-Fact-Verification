The '''Ark of the Covenant''' (ארון הברית in Hebrew language|Hebrew: ''aron hab'rit'') is described in the Bible as a holy container where the Ten Commandments and other holy Israelite objects are held.  According to the Bible, Yahweh commanded the ark be built when Moses had a prophetic vision at Biblical Mount Sinai|Sinai (Exodus 25:9-10).Further passages:  God communicated with Moses "from between the two cherubim" on the Ark's cover (Ex. 25:22). The Ark and its sanctuary were "the beauty of Israel" (Book of Lamentations|Lamentations 2:1). Some people believe the Ark contained Aaron's Rod, a jar of Manna, and the first Torah Scroll written by Moses, based on their reading of Book of Exodus, Book of Numbers, and the Letter to the Hebrews. The first of the Books of Kings says that during the time of King Solomon, the Ark held only the Ten Commandments.

Terminology
The Hebrew word ''aron'' is used in the Bible to designate any type of ark or chest, for any purpose (Genesis 50:26; Books of Kings|2 Kings 12:9, 10). The Ark of the Covenant is distinguished from all others by such titles as "Ark of God" (Books of Samuel|1 Samuel 3:3), "Ark of the Covenant" (Josh. 3:6; Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews 9:4), "Ark of the Testimony" (Ex. 25:22).
The Ark (aron kodesh in Hebrew meaning holy cupboard) is a raised cupboard found in Jewish Synagogues which contains the holy Torah scrolls. These are all written by hand and can take years to make. It is always on the wall of the Synagogue which faces towards Jerusalem.
When the Ark is opened and the Torah removed for reading everyone stands in respect of God. During some prayers and services the Ark doors an inner curtain (parochet) are kept open.

Description
The Bible describes the Ark as made of acacia or shittah-tree wood. It was a cubit and a half broad and high, and two and a half cubits long (about 130&nbsp;cm × 78&nbsp;cm × 78&nbsp;cm or 4.29 × 2.57 × 2.57 feet, for Egyptian royal cubit was most likely used). The Ark was covered all over with the purest gold.
