'''Malacology''' is the study of molluscs. These animals include snail|snails, slug|slugs, octopus, squid, and bivalves generally, such as clam|clams and mussel|mussels. Most of them have Animal shell|shells. The shells are often collected for their beauty and interest. Many people eat molluscs, especially those people who live near the ocean.

Those scientists who study molluscs are called ''malacologists''. They identify and classify them, and find out everything they can about their lives.

 Types 
= Types of gastropods =
The gastropods are the most common type of mollusc. They have about 70,000 described species.
 marine gastropod
 sea snail
 sea slug
 non-marine gastropod
 freshwater gastropod: with very few exceptions, the only freshwater molluscs are freshwater snails
 freshwater snail
 terrestrial animal|terrestrial gastropod: gastropods are the only group of molluscs which have some species living on land
 land snail
 land slug
 semi-slug

= Types of bivalves =
With 20,000 described species, bivalves are the second commonest class of molluscs. There are several classifications of bivalves in use. This is a rough guide:
Pteromorphia including the
File shells
Mussels
Oysters
Pearl oysters and pen shells
Heterodonta
Soft-shelled clams
Shipworms (''Turedo'')
Clam|Hard-shelled clams, cockles and razor shells
