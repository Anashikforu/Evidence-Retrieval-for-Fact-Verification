'''David IV''', also known as '''David II''' or '''David III''',Actually, he was the first of the unified Georgiaâ€™s kings to be named David. From this point of view, he was David I. But traditionally he is known as David IV being the fourth David in the ruling dynasty of Bagrationi. However, some Georgian historians mention him as David II referring the fact that he was the second David to have the title of ''King of the Georgians'' (adopted by the Bagrationi|Bagratid kings of Tao-Klarjeti in 888) whereas the two others were only ruling princes.
