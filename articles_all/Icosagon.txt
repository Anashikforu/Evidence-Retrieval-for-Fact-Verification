An '''icosagon''' is a Polygon|shape with 20 sides and 20 Vertex (geometry)|corners. It has interior angles of 162 and exterior angles of 198.

 Regular icosagon 
The ''regular polygon|regular icosagon'' has Schl√§fli symbol {20}, and can also be constructed as a truncated decagon, t{10}, or a twice-truncated pentagon, tt{5}. 

= Area =
The amount of space a regular icosagon takes up is

:\text{Area} = {5}a^2(1+\sqrt{5}+\sqrt{5+2\sqrt{5}}).

''a'' is the length of one of its sides.

Uses
The Big Wheel on the popular US game show ''The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right'' has an icosagonal cross-section.

The Globe, the outdoor theater used by William Shakespeare's acting company, was discovered to have been built on an icosagonal foundation when a partial excavation was done in 1989.Muriel Pritchett, University of Georgia 
As a golygonal path, the swastika is considered to be an irregular icosagon.


A regular square, pentagon, and icosagon can completely Euclidean tilings of convex regular polygons|fill a plane vertex.

 Dissection
Coxeter states that every parallel-sided 2''m''-gon can be divided into m(m-1)/2 rhombs. For the icosagon, ''m''=10, and it can be divided into 45: 5 squares and 4 sets of 10 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 10-cube, with 45 of 11520 faces. Coxeter, Mathematical recreations and Essays, Thirteenth edition, p.141 The list
