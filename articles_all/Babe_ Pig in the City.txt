'''''Babe: Pig in the City''''' is a 2001 sequel to the 1995 movie ''Babe (movie)|Babe''. It takes place in the fictional city of Metropolis. Because of the unexpected darker and more grown up subject matter (the movie includes a scene in which a dog almost drowns while hanging from a bridge), the movie was not received as well critically as the first ''Babe'' movie was, and reviews were generally mixed. However, it was also praised by some, and gained a cult following.
