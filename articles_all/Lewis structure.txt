The '''Lewis structures''', also called '''Lewis-dot diagrams''' or '''electron dot diagrams''' or '''Lewis dot structure'''  are pictures that show the bonding between a pair of electrons and the atoms of a molecule.

Each dot represents one electron. Two dots side by side represent a lone pair of electrons.

To show a bond between atoms, a line representing a pair of shared electrons is placed between the two atoms. This is showing water also known as H2O 

'''Rule:-'''
1. First we have to select central atom.

2. Central atom is that which is  present in list in number.

      if not 

3. central atom is that which has more number of valence electron.

4. hydrogen is never central atom.

5. then we arrange the rest of the atom and their electron as such they become '''stable'''.
