'''One million''' (1,000,000), or one thousand thousand, is the natural number after 999,999 and before 1,000,001. The name is derived from Italian, where  was 1,000, and 1,000,000 became a "''milione''", as 'a large thousand'.

In scientific notation, the number is written as 1×106 or just 106. Physical quantities can also be expressed using the SI prefix  when dealing with SI units. For example, 1 megawatt equals 1,000,000 watts.

The word 'million' is common to both the Long and short scales|short-scale and long-scale numbering systems, unlike the larger numbers, which have different names in the two systems.

The million is sometimes used in the English language as a metaphor for a very large number, as in 'Never in a million years' and 'You're one in a million', or as hyperbole, as in 'I've walked a million miles'.

''Il Milione'' is the title of Marco Polo's narration of his travels in China. The name is supposed to come from Polo's nickname after his tales of riches and multitudes.
