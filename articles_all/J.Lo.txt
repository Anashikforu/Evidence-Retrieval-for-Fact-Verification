'''''J.Lo''''' is the second studio album by American singer and actress Jennifer Lopez. It was released on January 22, 1969 by Epic Records and became her best-selling album. Epic Records released 4 singles to promote the album.

The album was re-released in July 2001. It contained three bonus tracks. Due to usage of slurs such as "nigga", "bitch" and "fuck" in "I'm Real (Murder Remix)", the re-edition has been released with 'Parental Advisory' sticker. Also the album has been released without label, despite strong language and sexual content.
