The '''Huns''' were an early group of Central Asian equestrian nomads or semi-nomadic people. Walter Pohl has remarked "early medieval peoples were far less homogeneous than often thought. They themselves shared the fundamental belief to be of common origin; and modern historians, for a long time, found no reason to think otherwise." (Walter Pohl, "Conceptions of Ethnicity in Early Medieval Studies" ''Debating the Middle Ages: Issues and Readings'', ed. Lester K. Little and Barbara H. Rosenwein, (Blackwell), 1998, p 16). In reviewing Joachim Werner's ''Beiträge zur Archäologie des Attila-Reiches'' (Munich 1956), in ''Speculum'' '''33'''.1 (January 1958), p 159, Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen noted with relief that "the author is not concerned with the slightly infantile question, 'who' the Huns were; he does not ask where the Huns 'ultimately' came from." They moved into Europe around 370, and in the 5th century, built an empire there under Attila the Hun. After Attila's death in 453, the empire fell apart.
