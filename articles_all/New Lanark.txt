History
New Lanark is a 18th century village and model industrial community with cotton mill buildings, workers' housing, and school. The small town was built by Robert Owen as an experiment in utopian idealism.

Between 1785 and 1968, some buildings were torn down or burned; and some new buildings were built. However, the overall appearance of the village stayed much like it was in the first half of the 19th century.

In 1975, the New Lanark Conservation Trust was established to prevent demolition of the village.Shadows of our Ancestors, 
In 2001, New Lanark was named a World Heritage Site.
