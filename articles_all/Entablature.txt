An '''entablature''' (IPA ɛnˈtæblətʃə; Latin, ''and tabula'', ''a tablet'') is a major piece of classical architecture. It is the big part of the building made of moldings and bands that sits flat above the columns, resting on their capital (architecture)|capitals (tops).  

An entablature is made of three parts: 
 the architrave - the bottom part which runs right above the wall or columns below
 the frieze – an unmolded strip that may or may not be decorated
 the cornice (architecture)|cornice - the top part which sticks out below the pediment.

The entabulature is an improvement on the older and less advanced lintel, which also sits between two posts and holds up roof rafters.
