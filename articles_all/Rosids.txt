The '''rosids''' are a large clade of flowering plants. It includes about 70,000 species, 

The rosids are divided into 17  order (biology)|orders. These orders together make up about 140 family (biology)|families. The rosids and the asterids are by far the largest clades in the eudicots.

Fossil rosids are known from the Cretaceous|Cretaceous period. Molecular clock estimates indicate that the rosids originated in the Aptian or Albian stages of the Cretaceous, between 125 and 99.6 million years ago (mya).

Three different definitions of the rosids are in use. Some authors include the order Saxifragales in the rosids. Others exclude it.
