The '''Pacific Electric Railroad Bridge''' or '''Southern Pacific Railroad Bridge''' is a historic railroad bridge in Torrance, California USA.  It spans across Torrance Boulevard at Bow Street, a short distance west of Western Avenue (Los Angeles)|Western Avenue.  It was once part of the north/south Torrance to San Pedro, California|San Pedro spur line of the Pacific Electric Railway.  The line was the railroad's first interurban line to San Pedro.  Gone too are the Pacific Electric's Torrance shops at the western branch of the split, now the site of an industrial park and which still receives trains on the local line.

The bridge was designed by Irving Gill and was built in 1913 as part of the original layout of the city as drawn up by Jared Sidney Torrance and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr..  It became the city's second entry in the National Register of Historic Places on July 13, 1989 after Torrance High School.
Though tracks and track parts remain on the bridge, it is no longer in use nor has it been for quite some time.  There is no chance of the bridge ever being used to carry trains again, since the right-of-way at either end has been changed and the tracks removed. Even so, the Pacific Electric Railroad Bridge has become a symbol of the city as part of the Torrance Police Department|Torrance Police Department's logo as of January 1, 2000, only the third such change in the department's history.
