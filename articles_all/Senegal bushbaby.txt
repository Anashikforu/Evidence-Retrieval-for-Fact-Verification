The '''Senegal bushbaby''' (''Galago senegalensis''), also known as the '''Senegal galago''', '''lesser galago''', or '''lesser bushbaby''' is a small, nocturnal primate which lives in trees. They prefer  dry woodland regions and savannah regions. At the end of the night, group members use a special rallying call and gather to sleep in a nest made of leaves, in a group of branches, or in a hole in a tree.

They are small primates (130mm and 95-300 grams) with woolly thick fur that ranges from silvery gray to dark brown. They are good jumpers.

Bush babies have 1-2 babies per litter, with gestation period being 110—120 days.
