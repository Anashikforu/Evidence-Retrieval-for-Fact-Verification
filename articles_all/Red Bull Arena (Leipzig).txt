The '''Red Bull Arena''' is a football stadium in Leipzig, Germany. It is the homeground of RB Leipzig. 

History
The Zentralstadion was built between 1954 and 1956. 100,000 visitors could enter the stadium. It was used for the sport festivals of the GDR, GDR football team matches, and other sports. The largest number of visitors was during a football match between SC Wismut Karl-Marx-Stadt and FC Kaiserslautern when 110,000 people entered.

It was renovated between 2000 and 2004. The renovation reduced the number of visitors that can enter the stadium. The first match in the new stadium was FC Sachsen Leipzig â€“ Borussia Dortmund (Amateure) in front of 28,000 visitors. Now it is only used for football matches and concerts.

In 2010, Red Bull bought the right to name the stadium for 30 years. It is now called "Red Bull Arena" and became the homeground of RB Leipzig, which is owned by Red Bull.
