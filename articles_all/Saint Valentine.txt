'''Saint Valentine''' is the name of many martyred saints that lived in Ancient Rome. At least three different people named Valentine are said to have died on the 14th of February.

In the Catholic church, Valentine was the patron of love, young people, and happy marriages.

 Valentine's Day 

There are many guesses about how Valentine's Day, a celebration of love, started. One legend says that Valentine, being a priest, performed secret wedding ceremonies when they were outlawed by Emperor Claudius II. When someone discovered that Valentine was breaking the law, he was ordered to be executed.

Another theory is that Valentine helped captive Christians to break out of prison. When he himself was in prison, Valentine may have sent the first love letter to a young girl who liked to visit him.
