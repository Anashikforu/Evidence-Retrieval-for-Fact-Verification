In cryptography, the '''EFF DES cracker''' (nicknamed "'''Deep Crack'''") is a machine built by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to perform a brute force attack|brute force search of Data Encryption Standard|DES cipher's key space — that is, to decrypt an encrypted message by trying every possible key. The aim in doing this was to prove that DES's key is not long enough to be secure.

The Data Encryption Standard|DES uses a 56-bit Key size|key, meaning that there are 256 possible keys under which a message can be encrypted. This is approximately 7.21 (more than 72 Names for large numbers|quadrillion). When DES was approved as a federal standard in 1976, a machine fast enough to test such a number of keys in a reasonable time would have cost an unreasonable amount of money to build.
