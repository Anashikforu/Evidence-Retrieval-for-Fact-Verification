An '''acrostic''' is a poetry|poem or other form of writing. In an acrostic, the first letter, syllable, or word of every line, paragraph, or other feature spells out a word or a message. It can be used to remember things. For example, Edgar Allan Poe wrote an acrostic poem in English:


'''E'''lizabeth it is in vain you say
"'''L'''ove not" — thou sayest it in so sweet a way:
'''I'''n vain those words from thee or L.E.L.
'''Z'''antippe's talents had enforced so well:
'''A'''h! if that language from thy heart arise,
'''B'''reath it less gently forth — and veil thine eyes.
'''E'''ndymion, recollect, when Luna tried
'''T'''o cure his love — was cured of all beside —
'''H'''is follie — pride — and passion — for he died.


The first letters of each line (E, L, I, Z, A, B, E, T, H) spell out ''Elizabeth''.
