In botany, '''shoots'''  are plant stem|stems plus the leaves and lateral buds, flowering stems and flower buds.  The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a '''shoot''' where leaves will develop.  In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants.

In everyday speech, shoots are often synonymous with stems.
