'''Absolute hot''' is the hottest temperature that matter can reach. It is measured at ''1.41678571 × 1032 kelvins'', ''2,556 x 10^28 degrees fahrenheit'' or ''1,420 x 10^30 degrees celsius.'' It is the opposite of absolute zero (which is -273.15°C on the celsius scale, −459.67 degrees on the fahrenheit scale or 0K on the kelvin scale). When something reaches this temperature, normal physics completely changes. It is the highest possible temperature that matter can ever attain.
