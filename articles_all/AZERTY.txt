'''AZERTY''' is a Keyboard (computer)|keyboard layout. It is very similar to the QWERTY keyboard layout. It is mainly used in France and Belgium.

It is almost the same as the '''QWERTY''' keyboard, but it swaps the letter Q and A, as well as W and Z. The letter M is moved from right to N to the position of the semicolon on '''QWERTY''' keyboards.
