A '''cross section''' is what one gets if one cuts an object into slices.

In geometry the correct definition of ''cross section'' is: the intersection of a Physical body|body in 2-dimensional Space (physics)|space with a line, or of a body in 3-dimensional space with a Plane (mathematics)|plane. 

A cross section, or '''section''' is also an orthographic projection of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a plane through the object. A floor plan is a section viewed from the top.
