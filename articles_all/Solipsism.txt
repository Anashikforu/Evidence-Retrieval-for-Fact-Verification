'''Solipsism''' () is the view that a person has no reason to believe anything wikt:exist|exists except their own mind." are the Latin words for "alone" and "self", which is where the word "solipsism" comes from. Some kinds of solipsism say that everything outside a person's own mind (including other people) is only wikt:imaginary|imaginary. Other kinds of solipsism instead say that nothing outside a person's own mind is wikt:certain|certain.

To only reject that the wikt:physical|physical world exists is not solipsism. Solipsism also rejects or doubts that other people exist. As an epistemology|epistemological position, it is the concept that nothing but one's own mind can be ''certain'' to exist. The existence of other minds, in this position, is considered a possibility, but not a certainty. Including time, which does not stop just because there would be nobody being to experience it (which is probably going to happen in the end of the universe when there would be simply nothing) Dancy, Jonathan; Ernest Sosa; Matthias Steup edited A Companion to Epistemology : Second Edition Volume 4 Wiley Blackwell 2010 page 747
