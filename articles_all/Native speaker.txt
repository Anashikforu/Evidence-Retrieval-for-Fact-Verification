A '''native speaker''' is someone who learned to speak a language as part of their childhood development. A native speaker's language is usually the language their parents speak and/or the language of their country of origin. It is the only language of a monolingual person, and likely the first language of a multilingual person which is acquired naturally in their native environment. It may serve as the basis for their sociolinguistic identity. 

A native speaker of a language has the following traits: 
# The speaker learnt the language in childhood,
# mastery of idiomatic forms of the language,
# comprehension of regional and social variance,
# fluent, spontaneous production and comprehension of discourse.
# Mastery of the grammar and vocabulary of the language tacitly.

Many people who hire language teachers prefer native speakers.
