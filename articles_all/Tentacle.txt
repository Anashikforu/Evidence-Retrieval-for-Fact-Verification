A '''tentacle''' is a part of the body of an animal or plant that can move freely. They are like arms. Some invertebrates, like squid, sea anemones or Hydra (animal)|hydras have them. They use the tentacles to catch food, or to grip the sourroundings. Some carnivore|carnivorous plants, such as the Drosera, also may have tentacles.
