'''Mania''' is a type of mood.  Mania is usually a symptom of a Illness|medical problem or a mental illness.  A person with mania is described as '''manic'''.

When people are manic, they usually have much more energy than usual.  They often have very strong emotions, and their moods may change very quickly.

The word "mania" comes from the Greek language (''μwordsανία'' means ''mania'').
Mania is a symptom, not an illness by itself.  Many different things can cause mania.  These things include illegal drugs and brain tumors.  However, most of the time, mania happens in people with bipolar disorder.  Bipolar disorder causes periods of mania that switch off with periods of Depression (mental illness)|depression.

Like with other symptoms, mania can be mild (not very bad), severe (very bad), or anywhere in between.  Mild mania is usually called "hypomania."  Very bad mania can cause psychosis, with hallucinations and delusions.

In some cases, people with mania may need to be hospitalized so they do not hurt themselves or other people.  On the other hand, many people with mania and hypomania have special creativity and artistic talents.Jamison, Kay R. (1996), ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', New York: Free Press,

 Causes 
'''Mental illness'''

Mania is usually a symptom of mental illness, most often bipolar disorder.  A diagnosis of Bipolar I disorder|type I bipolar disorder (bipolar I disorder) can be made based on a single manic episode.  This is the most common cause of mania.

However, if a person is hypomanic, they may have Bipolar II disorder|type II bipolar disorder or cyclothymia.

Also, if a person has psychosis that lasts longer than their mania, they may have schizoaffective disorder.

'''Medical causes'''

Mania is usually caused by a mental illness.  However, some medical illnesses can cause symptoms of mania.  Some doctors use the mnemonic E-MANIC to remember the possible medical causes of mania:
 '''Endocrine system|E'''Endocrine system|ndocrine: Hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or Cushing's syndrome can cause mania.  (These are all problems with hormones in the body)
 '''Medication|M'''Medication|edications: Many different medications can have mania as Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects.  These medications include amphetamines (often used to treat Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD); antidepressants; corticosteroids; Opioid|opiate painkillers, and many others.
 '''A'''buse of Alcoholism|alcohol or illegal drugs: Alcohol and many other drugs can cause mania.  These drugs include cocaine, Methamphetamine|amphetamines, phencyclidine (PCP), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), inhalants, Opioid|opiates, anabolic steroids, and Ecstasy (drug)|MDMA (Ecstasy).
 '''Neurology|N'''Neurology|eurologic problems: Many different problems with the brain can cause mania.  For example, brain tumors, Brain damage|brain injury, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease can all cause manic symptoms.
 '''Infection|I'''Infection|nfection: Infections in the brain can cause mania.  Examples include meningitis, brain infections caused by HIV/AIDS, and neurosyphilis (the last stage of syphilis, when the disease reaches the brain)
 '''Cardiovascular system|C'''Cardiovascular system|ardiovascular causes and '''Stroke|C'''Stroke|erebrovascular accidents (strokes)

Not having enough Vitamin B12|vitamin B-12 (vitamin B-12 deficiency) can also cause mania and psychosis.

Medical treatment
If mania is caused by a medical problem, the best thing to do is to treat that medical problem.

If mania is caused by a mental illness, the best treatment is a combination of medicines and psychotherapy (talking with a therapist or counselor).

Doctors usually treat mania with a combination of mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medicines.  While taking these medicines, the patient should see their doctor regularly to be checked for Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects. 
 
When the symptoms of mania have ended, long-term treatment then focuses on prophylactic|preventative treatment.  The goal of this kind of treatment is to prevent periods of mania or depression from happening.  Very often, this is done using a combination of drugs and psychotherapy.  Medication works best for bipolar disorder, and other mental illnesses, when it is combined with other treatments like psychotherapy.
