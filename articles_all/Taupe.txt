Originally, this referred only to the average color of the French mole,Maerz and Paul ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 205; Discussion of the color Taupe, Page 183 but like the colors pink and lavender (color)|lavender, the name expanded (in the case of ''taupe'' beginning in the 1940s) to encompass a wide range of varying shades.  It seems that this occurred because the color of the fur of the mole can itself be a wide range of shades, from gray through yellowish, brownish, and even purple|purplish.
