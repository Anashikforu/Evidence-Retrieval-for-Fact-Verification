In photosynthesis, a '''light-independent reaction''' takes place in plant chloroplasts. In this process, sugars are made from carbon dioxide. 

The process, known as the Calvin cycle, uses products of the light-dependent reactions (ATP and NADPH) and various enzymes.  Therefore, the light-independent reaction cannot happen without the light-dependent reaction. 

Sugars made in the light-independent reactions are moved around the plant  (Translocation (botany)|translocation). This takes place in the grana region of the chloroplast. It is anaerobic (does not use oxygen).

 The Calvin cycle 
#A sugar (Ribulose biphosphate or RuBP) made of 5 carbon atoms combines with carbon dioxide to form a 6-carbon sugar (phosphoglycerate). An enzyme called RuBisCO speeds this reaction up.
#Phosphoglycerate is redox|reduced with hydrogen atoms from the light-dependent reaction to form two molecules of triose phosphate (each has 3 carbon atoms). ATP is needed for this to occur.
#Some triose phosphate is converted (using ATP) back into Ribulose Biphosphate (which is why this is called a ''cycle'').
#The rest left over is used to produce glucose.

The sum of reactions in the Calvin cycle is the following:
:3  + 9 Adenosine triphosphate|ATP â†’ glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) + 2 H+ + 6 Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADP+ + 9 Adenosine diphosphate|ADP + 8 Pi &nbsp;&nbsp;(Pi = inorganic phosphate)
