Background
The 1938 tube stock was built as part of the London Passenger Transport Board's New Works Programme, that took place between 1935–1940. The trains are mainly meant to be used on the Northern and Bakerloo lines. Seven more trains were also to be used on the Piccadilly line.

During the 1950s and 1960s the Northern Line only used 1938 and London Underground 1949 Stock|1949 tube stock trains. These trains were starting to show how old they are by the late 1960s. The first trains were withdrawn from the Northern line in the early 1970s when they were replaced by the London Underground 1972 Stock|1972 tube stock trains. Some units are still in service from preservation.
