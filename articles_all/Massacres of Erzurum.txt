 British consul 
Following the massacres of Erzeroum of October 30, 1895, a British consul put the hand on two letters sent to his brother and to his parents by a Turkish soldier:"The Graphic", 07.12.1895, Massacres of Erzeroum of October 30, 1895

"My brother, if you want news from here, we killed 1 200 Armenians, all tiny rooms in pâtée for dog ...  Mother, I am healthy and except. Father, twenty days ago, we carried out the war against the Armenian incrédules. By the grace of God, no misfortune arrived to us. The rumour says that our battalion will be dispatched in your part of the world - if it is the case, we will kill all the Armenians there. Other share, 511 Armenians were wounded, and it perishes about it one or two each day. If you want news of the soldiers and bachi bouzouks, not only one did not bleed of the nose ...  That God blesses you."
