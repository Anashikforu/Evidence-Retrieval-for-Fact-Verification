An '''electron shell''', or main energy level, is the part of an atom where Electron cloud|electrons are found orbiting the Atomic nucleus|atom's nucleus.

In chemistry and atomic physics, an electron shell may be thought of as an orbit followed by Electron cloud|electrons around an Atomic nucleus|atom's nucleus. All atoms have one or more electron shell(s), all of which have varying numbers of electrons.  

Each electron shell has one or more electron sub-shells, or sub-levels. Electron shells make up the electron configuration of an atom. The number of electrons that can be in a certain shell is equal to 2n^2.

The name for electron shells came from the Bohr model, which states that electrons orbit the Nucleus (physics)|nucleus at certain distances so that their orbit|orbits form "shells". This term was presented by Niels Bohr|Niels Henrik David Bohr.

Valence shell
The valence shell is the outermost shell of an atom in its neutral state. The valence shell contains the electrons most likely to be involved in chemical reaction|reactions. 

In a noble gas, an atom tends to have eight electrons in its outer shell (except helium, which is only able to fill its shell with two electrons). Noble gases serve as the model for the octet rule, which states that atoms tend to form bonds or create ions so that they can have eight electrons in their outermost shell. This is mostly applicable to the Group (periodic table)|main-group elements of the second and third Periodic table|periods.

For Complex (chemistry)|coordination complexes containing transition metals, the valence shell consists of 18 electrons. This is referred to as the ''eighteen electron rule''.



 Sub-shells 

Electron sub-shells are identified by the letters s, p, d, f, g, h, i, etc., corresponding to the :en:Azimuthal quantum number|azimuth quantum numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. Each shell is able to hold 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18 electrons respectively.
