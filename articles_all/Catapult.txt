A '''catapult''' is a type of machine used as a weapon to throw mineral|rocks, large arrows, or other things such as hot tar, that would cause damage to something else.

Catapults use weights and levers to send the rocks or other things into the air.

Nowadays catapults are used to study old weapons, and as experiments (for example in physics or engineering classes). Some old ones are kept in museums.

Aircraft carriers use much more powerful steam catapults to throw airplanes into the air.
