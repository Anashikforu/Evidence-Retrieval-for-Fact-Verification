'''Omega''' (uppercase/lowercase '''Ω ω''') is the 24th and the last letter of the Greek alphabet. It stood for a long "o" sound in Ancient Greek. It still stands for "o" in Modern Greek language|Modern Greek, but there is no longer a difference between long and short vowels, so it sounds the same as Omicron. In the system of Greek numerals, it stands for the number 800.

It is also used to represent the Omega constant. which are the units of electrical resistance. In physics and other sciences, the lowercase ω is often used to represent angular frequency. 

In modern English, the phrase "From alpha to omega" expresses the idea of "everything".
