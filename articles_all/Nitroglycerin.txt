 Medical Uses 
Nitroglycerine is also used in some Medication|medicines because it is a Vasodilation|vasodilator.  This means it makes the blood vessels get wider.  That makes it easier for blood to flow through them.

Nitroglycerine is used mostly for Angina pectoris|angina and some Myocardial infarction|heart attacks caused by coronary artery disease.  This is a disease that makes the blood vessels that bring blood to the heart get narrower.  When the heart does not get enough blood and oxygen, a person can have angina (chest pain) or a heart attack.  Taking nitroglycerine makes the blood vessels get wider again, so more blood and oxygen can get to the heart.

Nitroglycerin is sometimes used in emergencies for other medical conditions caused by narrow blood vessels.
