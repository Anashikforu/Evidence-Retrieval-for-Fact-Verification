'''ATLAS''' ('''A''' '''T'''oroidal '''L'''HC '''A'''pparatu'''S''') is the biggest experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

It is one of the seven particle detector experiments (A Large Ion Collider Experiment|ALICE, ATLAS, Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS, TOTEM, LHCb, and LHCf) wikt:built|built at the LHC.  LHC is a new particle accelerator at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland. ATLAS is 46&nbsp;metres long and 25&nbsp;metres in diameter, weighing about 7,000&nbsp;tonnes. The project is led by Fabiola Gianotti. The project has 2,000 scientists and engineers at 165 institutions in 35 countries. --> ATLAS studies highly massive elementary particle|particles which could not be studied using earlier lower-energy accelerators. ATLAS may start new theory|theories of particle physics beyond the Standard Model.
