'''Religious persecution''' means unfair treatment of a particular group of people because of their religion. It aims at forcing the religious to go away or give up their religion. "Persecution" comes from a Latin word meaning "chase", and usually meant chasing someone in order to kill them. In later centuries the term was applied to other actions. Religious persecution may occur in the following forms:

violence, including pogroms
social discrimination 
not giving a job to a person because of his religion

Incidents of persecution are periodically reported in many countries. For example in case of India, the United States Department of State in its annual human rights report for 2006 noted attacks against the people of religious groups who are small in number.
