'''Les Cayes''' (Haitian Creole|Kréyòl: ''Okay''; ) is a town in southwest Haiti near the river ''Ravine du Sud'', on the Caribbean coast. It is the capital of the Sud Department|Sud ''Departments of Haiti|Département''.

Les Cayes is at about 196&nbsp;km southwest of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. It is also the chief town of an ''arrondissement'' (a part of a department) with the same name.
