'''Impact craters''' are formed by meteorites or comets striking the Earth or other solid body.  There is a system for recording and assessing craters.
 Largest craters on Earth 
The five largest ''confirmed'' impact structures are:
#Vredefort crater, South Africa: 160&nbsp;km diameter, 2023 million years ago.Revised estimate. #Chicxulub crater, Mexico: 150&nbsp;km diameter, 65 million years ago.
#Sudbury Basin, Ontario, Canada: 130&nbsp;km diameter, 1850 million years ago.
#Popigai crater, Russia: 90&nbsp;km diameter, 35.7 million years ago.
#Acraman crater, 90&nbsp;km diameter, South Australia, ~590 mya.
#Manicouagan crater, Quebec, Canada: 70&nbsp;km diameter, 214 million years ago.
There are some other suggested impact structures which are larger. It is a feature of the Earth that climate, weathering and plate tectonics removes most of the older features and events. In comparison, the Moon retains a nearly complete record of its past impact events. The Implication (grammar)|implication is that the Earth once suffered a similar bombardment in its early history. This period is known as the Late Heavy Bombardment, because it occurred after the Earth and Moon formed.

Any of these may or may not be meteorite craters:
#Australian impact structure: Northern Territory, Australia: multiple rings 600 km, 545 million years ago at the Neoproterozoic/Cambrian boundary.
#:en:Shiva_crater|Shiva crater, Indian Ocean, west of India: ~600&nbsp;km length, 400&nbsp;km width, 65 million years ago. Obviously this is of high interest, because of the date.

Identifying impact craters
The distinctive mark of an impact crater is the presence of rock which has undergone shock-metamorphic effects, shattered or melted rocks, and crystal deformations.French B.M. 1998. ''Traces of catastrophe: a handbook of shock-metamorphic effects in terrestrial meteorite impact structures''. LPI Contribution #954. Houston, Texas, USA: Lunar and Planetary Institute. A layer of shattered rock under the floor of the crater. This layer is called a 'breccia lens'.Breccia is a rock composed of broken fragments of minerals or rock cemented together by a fine-grained Matrix (geology)|matrix,Shatter cones, which are chevron-shaped impressions in rocks. Such cones are formed most easily in fine-grained rocks.Shatter cones are rare geological features that are only known to form in the bedrock beneath meteorite impact craters or underground nuclear explosions. They are evidence that the rock has been subjected to a high-pressure shock.
High-temperature rock types, including laminated and welded blocks of sand, tektites, or glassy spatters of molten rock. They may have relatively large amounts of trace elements that are associated with meteorites, such as nickel, platinum, iridium, and cobalt.
Microscopic pressure deformations of minerals. These include fracture patterns in crystals of quartz and feldspar, and formation of high-pressure materials such as diamond, derived from graphite and other carbon compounds, or varieties of shocked quartz.
