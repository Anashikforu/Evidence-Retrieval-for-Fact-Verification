The '''2011 Pacific typhoon season''' was an event in which tropical cyclones formed in the Western Pacific Ocean. The season ran throughout 2011 with most tropical cycle agency storming between May and November. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100th meridian east and the 180th meridian.

Within the Northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies who assign names to tropical cyclones. This can often result in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency named a tropical cyclone if it was judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65&nbsp;km/h (40&nbsp;mph) anywhere in the basin.

While the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigned names to tropical cyclones which moved into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N and 25°N even if the cyclone has had a name assigned to it by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Tropical depressions that were monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center were given a number with a "W" suffix. On average, 27 storms form in this basin every year.

Seasonal forecasts


During each season several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones, tropical storms, and typhoons will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country.

=City University of Hong Kong=
Since the 2000 Pacific typhoon season, the Guy Carpenter Asia-Pacific Climate Impact Centre (GCACIC), of the City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK), have issued tropical cyclone seasonal forecasting|forecasts of activity for each upcoming typhoon season. On May 4 and July 5, 2011, the GCACIC issued forecasts which predicted the amount of tropical cyclones, tropical storms and typhoons there would be during 2011 as well as for how many tropical cyclones will make landfall on China or pass within 100&nbsp;km (60&nbsp;mi) of the Korean Peninsula or Japan.

This season the GCACIC predicted in May that 31 tropical cyclones, 27 tropical storms, and 17 typhoons would either form or move into the northwestern Pacific this year. In their July forecast, the GCACIC lowered their prediction for the number of tropical storms developing into a typhoon by one which they blamed on the strength of the India-Burma trough. For Southern China the GCACIC predicted in May that seven tropical cyclones would make landfall, during the year compared to an average of five. They further predicted that five of the cyclones would make landfall on Southern China between May and August, while the other two would landfall between September and December. After two tropical cyclones had made landfall on Southern China during June, the July GCACIC forecast predicted that seven tropical cyclones would make landfall, during the main season between July and December. For the Korean Peninsular and Japan, the GCACIC predicted in May that six tropical cyclones would affect either Japan or the peninsular during the year compared to an average of four, and predicted that there would be an above average amount of landfalls on Japan. After three tropical cyclones affected the region in May and June, the GCACIC predicted that seven tropical cyclones would affect either the Korean Peninsular or Japan during the main part of the season.

=Tropical Storm Risk Consortium=
Since the 2000 Pacific typhoon season, the Tropical Storm Risk Consortium (TSR) of University College London have issued forecasts of activity for each upcoming typhoon season. Forecasts on the number of tropical storms, typhoons and intense typhoons there would be during 2011 in the Western Pacific were released in March, May, July and August.According to TSR: An intense typhoon is a typhoon that has one-minute winds of at least 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph); according to the JMA, an intense typhoon has ten-minute winds of at least 54&nbsp;m/s (105&nbsp;kt) In all of their forecasts this year, TSR predicted that the season would see activity close to the average with 28&nbsp;tropical storms, 18&nbsp;typhoons and 8&nbsp;intense typhoons developing during the season.

=National meteorological service predictions=
On January 17, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) reported that they were expecting between 20 and 22 tropical cyclones to pass through the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|Philippine area of responsibility during 2011. On June 30, Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau predicted that the 2011 season would be near its normal climatic average of 25.7, and predicted that 22-26 tropical storms, would occur over the Western Pacific during 2011, with 3 to 5 of them affecting Taiwan.

Storms
=Tropical Depression (01W)=

On April&nbsp;1, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring an Low-pressure area|area of low pressure associated with intermittent Atmospheric convection|convection over the South China Sea, roughly 535&nbsp;km (335&nbsp;mi) east-southeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.


=Tropical Depression (Amang)=

On March&nbsp;30, the JMA began monitoring an area of low pressure southwest of Yap.


=Tropical Storm Aere (Bebeng)=

Early on May 4, an area of low pressure formed about 140&nbsp;km (85&nbsp;mi) to the west of Palau Island. In the afternoon of May 6, Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the low pressure into a tropical depression. In the same evening, PAGASA upgraded the low pressure into a tropical depression and assigned its local name 'Bebeng'. In the afternoon of May 7, Japan Meteorological Agency|JMA upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm, and assigned the name 'Aere'. During the early morning of May 12, the Japan Meteorological Agency|JMA downgraded Aere to a tropical depression while south of Kyushu Island.

Throughout the Philippines, multiple agencies activated their emergency plans as the storm approached. The Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Philippine National Police, and the Philippine Coast Guard were all placed on standby to deploy to areas struck by Aere once the storm passed. Several ports were affected by the storm, stranding 1,379 passengers by the afternoon of May&nbsp;7.


=Typhoon Songda (Chedeng)=

On May 19, the JTWC reported that an area of low pressure had persisted about 510&nbsp;km (320&nbsp;mi) to the southeast of Yap. As the system moved towards the northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge of high pressure, it rapidly consolidated in an area of light to moderate vertical windshear. The JMA then started to monitor the system as a tropical depression later that day, before the JTWC designated it as Tropical Depression 04W early on May 20. The JTWC then reported later that day that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm with windspeeds of 65&nbsp;km/h (40&nbsp;mph), however it later reported that it had overestimated the windspeeds and consequently lowered the storm's status to a tropical depression, based on observations from Yap island. Late on May 21, both the JMA and the JTWC reported that the depression had now become a tropical storm with the JMA naming it as Songda. Over the next couple of days, the system gradually intensified further while moving northwest into PAGASA's area of responsibility. PAGASA named it as Chedeng. At 1200&nbsp; UTC on May 24, the JTWC reported that Songda had intensified into a typhoon. 12 hours later the JMA followed suit while the system was about 800&nbsp;km (500&nbsp;mi) to the southeast of Metro Manila|Manila in the Philippines. It rapidly intensified into a Category 5 typhoon. In the afternoon of May 29, Songda became extratropical south of Shikoku Island.

Although Songda remained offshore, heavy rains within the typhoon's Rainband|outer bands impacted the Philippines, causing significant flash flooding and landslides. Four fatalities are attributed to the system there.


=Tropical Depression=

During the evening of May 31, the JMA upgraded an area of low pressure to a tropical depression. Initially, the tropical depression was about 400&nbsp;km (250&nbsp;miles) southwest of Hong Kong. The system did not develop further and was downgraded to an area of low pressure by the JMA on June 2.


=Tropical Storm Sarika (Dodong)=

On early June 8, an area of low pressure formed about 10&nbsp;km west of Cebu City, Philippines. As it moved towards the Mindoro Strait the Japan Meteorological Agency|JMA and Joint Typhoon Warning Center|JTWC began to monitor the system. In the early morning hours of June 9, the Philippines' Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|PAGASA upgraded the system to a tropical depression and reported the storm center to be about 450&nbsp;km west of Dagupan City in the Philippines. The next day, the JMA and JTWC upgraded the tropical depression into a tropical storm, with the JMA naming it Sarika. During the morning of June 11 the JTWC downgraded Sarika to a tropical depression after making landfall in Shantou, China. The JTWC soon issued their final advisory on Sarika. Sarika made landfall on mainland China with winds of 75&nbsp;km/h (45&nbsp;mph). As a result of the storm, 23 people were killed in Xianning, and ten more were declared missing. Damages from Sarika are estimated at $248 million.


=Tropical Depression=

Early June 15 an area of low pressure area embedded along the Intertropical Convergence Zone about 250&nbsp;km west of Puerto Princesa, Palawan. As is moved towards the South China Sea, both the JMA and the JTWC started monitoring it. During the morning of June 15, the JMA upgraded it into a tropical depression. Due to an anticyclone, the system dissipated during the early morning of June 16,as it made landfall in Hong Kong.As it drifted over Hong Kong, the Hong Kong observatory's radar captured the center of the system.


=Tropical Storm Haima (Egay)=

On June 15, the JTWC started to monitor an area of disturbed weather that was about 1350&nbsp;km (835&nbsp;mi), to the southeast of Manila, Philippines. Over the next couple of days the system gradually developed further, before late on June 16, the JMA, JTWC and PAGASA, all reported that the system had developed into a tropical depression, with PAGASA naming it as Egay. Egay continued to develop during June 17 as it moved towards the northeast, and on June 18 the JTWC reported that Egay had intensified into a tropical storm. Late on June 19, the JTWC downgraded Egay to a tropical depression, but they upgraded Egay again to a tropical storm on June 20. Early on June 20, the JTWC downgraded Egay to a tropical depression again. On June 21, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm and named it Haima, with the JTWC following suit on June 22.

During the evening of June 23, the JTWC downgraded Haima to a tropical depression after making landfall in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, People's Republic of China|China but upgraded it to a tropical storm again on June 24. Early on June 25, Haima became a tropical depression after moving inland in Vietnam. As it made landfall over Hanoi, Vietnam, the JTWC and the Hong Kong Observatory downgraded Haima to a low pressure area.


=Severe Tropical Storm Meari (Falcon)=

Early on June 20, and area of low pressure about 760&nbsp;km (470&nbsp;miles), east of the Philippines began to be monitored by both the JTWC and JMA. That evening, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Soon afterwards, PAGASA upgraded the system into a tropical depression, naming it as "Falcon". At the time of the upgrade, Falcon was about 1000&nbsp;km (620&nbsp;miles), east northeast of Cebu City. During the evening of June 21, the JTWC also reported that Falcon had strengthened into a tropical depression. On June 22, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Falcon into a tropical storm, and the JMA named it Meari. Meari leaves Philippines with 2 deaths and 5 missing. In the afternoon on June 24, the JMA upgraded Meari to a severe tropical storm as it passed Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa, Japan.

On June 26, Meari rapidly moved to the Yellow Sea but slowly passed Weihai, Shandong, People's Republic of China|China, and then the JMA downgraded Meari to a tropical storm on the same day. On June 27, the JTWC downgraded Meari to a tropical depression before it made landfall in North Korea, and the JMA reported that Meari became a low pressure area later.

Heavy rains from the storm's outer bands triggered significant flooding and landslides in South Korea. At least nine people were killed and three others were reported missing across the country.


=Tropical Depression Goring=

Late July 9, 2011, an area of low pressure area formed about 300&nbsp;km (186&nbsp;mi) east of Aurora. The center was  north of Basco, Batanes. On the morning of July 9, JMA upgraded the low pressure area into a tropical depression and it was 450&nbsp;km northeast of Cagayan. In the afternoon, PAGASA upgraded the low pressure area into a tropical depression and named it Goring. After moving to Fujian, China, it weakened into an overland low pressure area on the evening on July 10.The remnant low of Goring appears to have redeveloped into a 2011 Pacific typhoon season#Tropical Depression .28Goring.29|Tropical Depression on July 16


=Typhoon Ma-on (Ineng)=

On July 11, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded a tropical disturbance to a tropical depression which was near Minamitorishima. On July 12, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Ma-on. Early on July 13, the JMA upgraded Ma-on to a severe tropical storm. Late on July 13, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded Ma-on to a typhoon. After absorbing Tokage, Ma-on reached its peak strength on July 16. The PAGASA named it Ineng on July 17.

As Ma-on was affecting Japan, the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm in the evening on July 19. Ma-on made landfall in Tokushima Prefecture|Tokushima later. The JMA downgraded Ma-on to a severe tropical storm after it made landfall in Wakayama Prefecture|Wakayama early on July 20. The JTWC downgraded Ma-on to a tropical depression on July 21 and discontinued advisories the following day. The JMA downgraded Ma-on to a tropical storm early on July 23. On July 24, Ma-on weakened into an extratropical cyclone east of the Tōhoku region.


=Tropical Storm Tokage (Hanna)=

A low pressure area has formed about 740&nbsp;km north-northwest of Palau. Early on July 14, the JMA upgraded it into a tropical depression, and the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. On July 15, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Tokage, and the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression later. PAGASA also upgraded it to a tropical depression and named it Hanna. Due to the Fujiwhara effect, Typhoon Ma-on, the powerful storm just northeast of Tokage, later weakened Tokage to a tropical depression and completely absorbed it early on July 16.


=Tropical Depression=

It can be traced back to a Tropical Depression on July 10, which made landfall over Fujian, China.The remnant low of the weak depression drifted back south, and entered the South China Sea on July 13, and later started to reintensify as it drift back inland, the JMA reported that a low has strengthen into tropical depression as it drifted over Guangdong, China on July 16. On July 17, the depression dissipated completely.


=Tropical Depression=

Originally a low pressure area, the JMA reported that a tropical depression formed from it in the Gulf of Tonkin near Guangdong, China on July 16. However, it quickly dissipated after only six hours.


=Severe Tropical Storm Nock-ten (Juaning)=

Early on July 22, an area of low pressure formed to the east of Philippines.

The provinces of Albay and Camarines were reported to be completely flooded by the rain.


=Typhoon Muifa (Kabayan)=

Late on July 23, an area of low pressure formed to the southeast of Chuuk. After weakening to a tropical storm, Muifa made landfall at the estuary of the Yalu River on August 8, and the JTWC issued the final warning. Early on August 9, Muifa weakened to a tropical depression in Northeast China and became a low pressure area later.

Muifa killed 2 men, as their boat was capsized in the vicinity of Hagonoy, Bulacan and Pampanga Delta.


=Tropical Depression (Lando)=

On July 28, an area of low pressure formed about  to the West of Guam. But despite this, Tropical Depression Lando regenerated soon afterwards, and the JMA reissued their advisories on Lando. Tropical Depression Lando continued to persist for another day, as it slowly tracked eastward, just off the western coast of Luzon. Then, during the late afternoon of August 2, the JMA stopped tracking Lando, as it had dissipated. Early on August 3, the remmants of Tropical Depression Lando dissipated completely, without ever reaching Luzon.


=Severe Tropical Storm Merbok=

Early on August 3, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded an area of low pressure near Wake Island to a tropical depression. 


=Tropical Depression=

Early on August 3, a tropical depression formed near the Bonin Islands. The system slowly began to track northwestwards, towards Japan. Late on August 4, the system dissipated near the Kii Peninsula.


=Tropical Depression (13W)=

Late on August 8, the JMA upgraded a low pressure area to a tropical depression west of Guam, and the JTWC issued a TCFA. However, the JMA continued to track the remants as a weak tropical depression over the next few days until the system dissipated on August 15.


=Tropical Depression=

Late on August 8, the JMA upgraded an area of low pressure to a tropical depression, to the northwest of Minamitorishima. 


=Tropical Depression=

On August 19, a low pressure area developed east-northeast of Guam.


=Typhoon Nanmadol (Mina)=

Late on August 19, an area of low pressure developed north of Palau.

On August 27, five people died after Nanmadol caused landslides.


=Typhoon Talas=

Late on August 22, an area of low pressure developed to the west of Guam. 


=Tropical Storm Noru=

On September 1, a low pressure area formed to the northeast of Guam.

Late on September 4, Noru's LLCC that remained partially exposed since formation unexpectedly became elongated and started weakening. However, data from an ASCAT scatterometer pass depicted that the LLCC had an expansive area of strong tropical storm force winds along the eastern and northern peripheries. A TUTT cell wrapped the east and northeastern sides of Noru suppressing its outflow. 


=Tropical Storm Kulap (Nonoy)=

Late on September 4, an area of low pressure developed to the southeast of Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa, Japan. and continued to track Kulap's remnants as a tropical depression until it finally dissipated early on September 11.


=Typhoon Roke (Onyok)=

Early on September 8, a cluster of thunderstorms came together as a low pressure area with imporoving outflow and a developing low-level circulation center (LLCC).


=Typhoon Sonca=

Early on September 13, a low pressure area formed northeast of the Northern Mariana Islands. 


=Tropical Depression=

Early on September 14, the JMA started monitoring a cluster of thunderstorms to the southeast of Taiwan as a tropical depression. But because of the land interaction, the system could not be empowered and the JMA stopped tracking the depression late on September 15, as the system dissipated.


=Typhoon Nesat (Pedring)=

In the evening of September 21, a low pressure area developed to the east-southeast of Palau.

=Tropical Storm Haitang=

On the evening of September 21, at almost the same time when Nesat was first seen, another low pressure area persisted far south of Hong Kong. The low slowly drifted north and strengthened slowly until on September 24, when the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression east of Vietnam. Early on September 25, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it ''Haitang''.

=Typhoon Nalgae (Quiel)=


On September 26, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to monitor a weak tropical depression. It had developed about  to the northwest of Manila in the Philippines.

The storm slowly drifted to the west. It got stronger slowyl. Nalgae developed a microwave eye like feature and well defined convective banding in all the quadrants. The system had a tiny radius of winds. It was still strengthening significantly and was very well defined. Late on September 29, the JMA upgraded Nalgae to a typhoon. Nalgae quickly intensified on September 30, and became a category 4 super typhoon early on October 1. This was just before making landfall over Luzon. Due to land interaction and colder sea surface temperature in the South China Sea, the JMA downgraded Nalgae to a severe tropical storm on October 2. Then a tropical storm late on October 3. The JTWC downgraded Nalgae to a tropical depression on October 4. The JMA also did it on the next day. Later on October 5, the last low of Nalgae dissipated.

Hitting the Philippines just days after Typhoon Nesat, Nalgae caused further damage across Luzon. It was first feared that Nalgae would cause much more damage to Luzon. But damage from the storm was lighter than Typhoon Nesat. Nearly 2,900 homes were destroyed and about another 15,400 took damage. At least 18 people were killed by the storm and another 7 were reported as missing as of October&nbsp;11. A total of 1,113,763 people were affected by the storm. Total losses in the country reached just over 115&nbsp;million PHP (US$2.62&nbsp;million).


=Tropical Storm Banyan (Ramon)=


On October 7, the JTWC started monitoring a tropical disturbance about 750&nbsp;km (465&nbsp;mi) to the south of Hagåtña, Guam. Early on October 10, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression called ''23W''. The PAGASA also upgraded it to a tropical depression and named it ''Ramon''. On October 11, the JMA and the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it ''Banyan''. Early on October 12, Banyan made landfall over Leyte, Philippines. The JTWC downgraded it to a tropical depression. A half day later, the JMA also downgraded Banyan to a tropical depression. The system dissipated in the South China Sea on October 16.

While going through the Philippines, Banyan had heavy rains across much of the country. This led to widespread flooding. At least ten people were killed by the storm. A total of 75,632 people were affected by the storm.


=Severe Tropical Storm Washi (Sendong)=


On December 11, a disturbance formed and stayed near Chuuk State|Chuuk. On December 13, the low pressure area quickly got stronger. On the same day, the JTWC upgraded the low pressure to a tropical depression. They named it ''27W''. The JMA also upgraded it to a tropical depression. The JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm on December 14. They then downgraded it to a tropical depression early on December 15. The PAGASA called it ''Sendong'' as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility. After passing Palau on December 15, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm. They named it ''Washi''. On December 16, Washi made landfall over Surigao del Sur, a province of the Philippines. Several hours later, Washi arrived at the Sulu Sea and regained its strength quickly. Late on December 17, Washi crossed Palawan, and arrived at the South China Sea. On December 19, Washi weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated.


Storm Names
Within the Northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies who assign names to tropical cyclones which often results in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency names tropical cyclones should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65&nbsp;km/h, (40&nbsp;mph), to the north of the equator between the 180th meridian|180° and 100th meridian east|100°E. Whilst the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N-25°N even if the cyclone has had a name assigned to it by the Japan Meteorological Agency.

=International names=

Tropical Cyclones are named from the following lists by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in Tokyo, Japan, once they reach tropical storm strength. The next 24 names on the naming list are listed here.



=Retirement=

During their 2012 annual session the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee said that the name Washi would be retired from its naming lists. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said that the names Bebeng, Juaning, Mina, Pedring were retired from PAGASA's list of local names after they each caused over 1&nbsp;billion PHP in damages to the Philippines during 2011.

Season effects
This table lists all the storms that developed in the western Pacific Ocean to the west of the International Date Line during the 2011 season. It includes their intensity, duration, name, landfalls, deaths, and damages. All damage figures are in 2011 USD. Damages and deaths from a storm include when the storm was a precursor wave or extratropical low.






Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE)

The table on the right shows the Accumulated Cyclone Energy|ACE for each storm in the season. Broadly speaking, the ACE is a measure of the power of a typhoon multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong typhoons, have high ACEs. ACE is calculated for only full advisories on specifically tropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 34&nbsp;knots (63&nbsp;km/h, 39&nbsp;mph), or tropical storm strength. Accordingly, tropical depressions are not included here. The ACE also does not include subtropical storms. Later the JMA reexamines the data, and produces a final report on each storm, which can lead to the ACE for a storm being revised either upward or downward. Until the final reports are issued, ACEs are, therefore, provisional.
