Effective speech includes the following elements – fluency, flexibility, accuracy, and comprehensibility.

 '''Fluency''' is the ability to communicate an intended message, or affect the listener in the way that is intended by the speaker.  

'''Flexibility''' is the ability to adjust the message according to the responses of the listener. It also involves choosing words and expressions which will be understood by the listener(s). Compare with Cross-cultural communication.

 '''Accuracy''' is the use of proper grammar in spoken language.

 '''Comprehensibility''' is the ability to be understood by others. There are three components of sound which influence one’s comprehensibility: 
::''Pronunciation'': saying the sounds of words correctly; 
::''Intonation'': applying proper stress and rhythm while speaking; and 
::''Enunciation'': speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and volume.
