'''Quinoa''' (''Chenopodium quinoa''; ( is a species of goosefoot (''Chenopodium''). It is a grain-like crop grown primarily for its edible seeds. 

Quinoa is not a real cereal, or grain, but more of a vegetable, as it is not a member of the Poaceae|grass family. As a Chenopodioieae|chenopod, quinoa is closely related to species such as beets, spinach, and tumbleweeds. Its leaves are also eaten as a leaf vegetable, much like amaranth. Quinoa greens are not widely available for purchase.  Quinoa gives high quality protein and other nutrients. It has been called a 'superfood'.
