 Critical reception
John Jaeger, in an article published by the Association of College and Research Libraries, said of the Jewish Virtual Library: 
"This library, once it is entered, is more like a living encyclopedia than it is anything else. One has options to click on, such as history, women, biography, politics, Israel, maps, and Judaic Treasures at the Library of Congress, with each launching a person into a different realm. The site is extremely well put together.John Jaeger, 
Karen Evans of Indiana State University wrote that the site covers many different topics, with "easily accessible, balanced information".Karen Evans, Jewish Virtual Library at the Internet Reviews Archive, College and Research Libraries News, a division of the American Library Association at Bowdoin College, Oct 2002 (courtesy link:
