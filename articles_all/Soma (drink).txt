'''Soma''' is a drink used in ancient India, in the (Vedic) culture. It is written of in the Vedas, in which there are many hymns praising it. 

It was probably a juice made from a mountain plant or the haoma plant. In the Vedas, Soma is both the sacred drink and also a god (deva). It is not known for sure what Soma actually was.

Soma is similar to the Greek drink, ambrosia. According to their beliefs it is what the gods drink, and what made them gods. Indra and Agni are known for drinking a lot of Soma. Mortals also drink it, giving them visions that are thought to be divine. The ''Rigveda|Rig-Veda'' (''8.48'') states, "We have drunk the Soma; we have become immortality|immortal; we have gone to the light; we have found the gods." The Ninth Mandala of the ''Rig Veda'' is known as the Soma Mandala. It is mostly hymns to Soma.
