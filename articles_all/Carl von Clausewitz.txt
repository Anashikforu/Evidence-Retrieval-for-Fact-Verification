'''Carl Philipp Gottlieb von Clausewitz''' ( Clausewitz.com. Accessed 2007-06-31. â€“ November 16, 1831 in Breslau) was a Prussian general who fought in the Napoleonic Wars. He joined the Russian Army to fight against the French invasion of Russia. Later, he wrote about war and the military.

He wrote the book ''On War'', in which he said that "War is the continuation of politics by other means." In his book, ''On War'', Clausewitz wrote how to win a war, how to build an army, and what war is.  He did not think war was an art or a science.  Instead, war was about people, money, and land.
