The '''Firmicutes''' are a phylum of bacteria, most of which have the Gram-positive type of cell walls.

 Classes 
The group is typically divided into the Clostridia, which are Anaerobic organism|anaerobic, the Bacilli, which are aerobic, and the Mollicutes, a class of bacteria which do not have cell walls. 

On phylogenetic trees, the first two groups show up as paraphyletic or polyphyletic, as do their main genera, ''Clostridium'' and ''Bacillus''.

 Health 
Firmicutes make up the largest portion of the mouse and human gut microbiome.
