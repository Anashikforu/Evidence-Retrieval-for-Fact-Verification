The '''Lorentz contraction''', also called '''Length contraction''', '''Fitzgerald contraction''' or '''Lorenz-Fitzgerald contraction''', is the phenomenon that a moving object becomes shorter than it was when measured in its rest frame. 
In his book, ''One, Two, Three...Infinity,'' physicist George Gamow quoted a limerick (a kind of poem) that is said by some to have been changed from a more naughty poem. There are several other cleaned up versions:


There once was a young man named Fisk,
Whose wikt:fencing|fencing was extremely wikt:brisk|brisk,
So fast was his action,
The Lorentz contraction,
wikt:foreshorten|Foreshortened his wikt:foil|foil to a wikt:disk|disk.
