A '''chosen-plaintext attack (CPA)''' is a model for cryptanalysis which assumes that the attacker can choose random plaintexts to be encrypted and obtain the corresponding ciphertexts. The goal of the attack is to gain some further information which reduces the security of the encryption scheme.  In the worst case, a chosen-plaintext attack could expose secret information after calculating the Key (cryptography)|secret key. 

Modern cryptography is implemented in software or hardware and is used for a diverse range of applications; for many applications, a chosen-plaintext attack is often very feasible.  Chosen-plaintext attacks become extremely important in the context of Public-key cryptography|public key cryptography, where the encryption key is public and attackers can encrypt any plaintext they choose.

Any cipher that can prevent chosen-plaintext attacks is then also guaranteed to be secure against known-plaintext attack|known-plaintext and ciphertext-only attacks; this is a conservative approach to security.

Two forms of chosen-plaintext attack can be distinguished:

'''Batch chosen-plaintext attack''', where the cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst chooses all plaintexts before any of them are encrypted.
'''Adaptive chosen-plaintext attack''', where the professional cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst makes a series of interactive queries, choosing subsequent plaintexts based on the information from the previous encryptions.
