A '''propeller''' makes an airplane|aircraft, ship, or submarine in water or air go by making a big wind or a strong stream. It does this by turning two or more wings very quick.  The blades of a propeller act as rotating wings, and produce force through application of both Bernoulli's principle and Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law, generating a difference in pressure between the forward and rear surfaces of the airfoil-shaped blades.
