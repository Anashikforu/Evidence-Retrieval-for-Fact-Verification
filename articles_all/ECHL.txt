The '''ECHL''' (formerly '''East Coast Hockey League''') is a professional ice hockey league based in the United States and is considered a lower tier than the American Hockey League. 

 Overview 
The ECHL and the American Hockey League are the only ice hockey leagues that receive recognition by the collective bargaining agreement between the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players' Association which means that any player that is signed to an entry-level NHL contract and is designated for assignment must report to a club either in the AHL or the ECHL. 

The major championship in the ECHL that the two winning team of their conferences play for is the Kelly Cup. There are currently 27 teams in the ECHL.
