The '''Group 14 elements''', also known as the '''carbon group''' and the '''Group IV elements''', is a group (periodic table)|group of chemical element|elements on the periodic table. Each element has 4 valence electrons. Only carbon makes anions. Silicon and germanium are semimetals. Tin and lead are poor metals. Ununquadium, a radioactive element, is not stable enough to see its properties. All of them can form +4 oxidation state compounds. Tin and lead can form +2 compounds, too.
