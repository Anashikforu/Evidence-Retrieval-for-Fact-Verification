The Quaternary began about 2.6 million years ago, and continues today. A great deal of information is considered when geologists discuss the timing of periods.Gibbard P.L. ''et al'' 2007. 
In the Quarternary were the glaciations known as the Ice Age. Also, Homo sapiens|anatomically modern humans evolved. During the Quaternary,  many large mammalian species became extinct. This was due to climate change and hunting by humans.Martin P.S. and Klein R.G. eds 1984. ''Quaternary extinctions: a prehistoric revolution''. Arizona, Tucson AZ.
