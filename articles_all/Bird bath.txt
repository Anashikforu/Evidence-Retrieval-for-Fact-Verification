A '''bird bath''' is an artificial "puddle" or small shallow pond, created with a water-filled basin, for birds to bathe in, cool off, and drink from. A bird bath can be a garden decoration, small reflecting pool, or outdoor sculpture.

A bird bath is an attraction for many different species of birds to visit gardens, especially during the summer and drought periods. Bird baths that provide clean and continual water all year makes more birds come.
