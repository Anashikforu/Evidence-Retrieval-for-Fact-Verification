'''Vitiligo''' is a skin disease that causes the skin to lose its color.  It occurs when the melanocytes, cells that give skin their color, die or do not work. This is a problem because these cells protect against the light from the sun.

 How is it caught? 
The exact cause of vitiligo is complex and not fully understood. It may be caused by the immune system, genetic, and environmental factors. 
Vitiligo may also be caused by stress that affects the immune system, leading the body to react and start eliminating skin pigment.

People over 20 years old rarely develop this disease. These patches often occur to both sides symmetry|symmetrically and may change shape.

 Effects of vitiligo
