'''Compressive strength''' measures the pushing Force (physics)|force that one needs to break a material. 

When the limit of compressive strength is reached, materials are crushed. Concrete can be made to have high compressive strength e.g. many concrete floors have compressive strength of 3000 p.s.i..
