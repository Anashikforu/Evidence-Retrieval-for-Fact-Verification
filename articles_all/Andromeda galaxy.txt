The 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed that M31 contains a trillion stars (1012).
 This is more than the number of stars in our own galaxy, which is estimated to be c. 200-400 billion.

Andromeda is estimated to be 7.1 solar masses.
 In comparison, a 2009 study estimated that the Milky Way and Andromeda are about equal in mass,


At an apparent magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda galaxy is notable for being one of the brightest Messier objects.


The Andromeda galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at about 100 to 140 kilometres per second (62 to 87&nbsp;mi/s),
 so it is one of the few blue shifted galaxies. The Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way are thus expected to wikt:collide|collide in perhaps 4.5&nbsp;billion years.
 The Milky Wayâ€“Andromeda collision is likely to make the galaxies merge, to form a giant Ellipse|elliptical galaxy.
 Such events do happen in galaxy groups. However, 4.5 billion years is a vast period of time, roughly equal to the time the Earth has existed as a planet.

 Satellite galaxies 
Orbiting M31 are at least 13 Dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies. the brightest and largest is M110, which can be seen with a basic telescope. The second-brightest and closest one to M31 is Messier 32|M32.

 Observational history 


The Persian astronomer Al Sufi was the first man to record seeing the Andromeda galaxy. He called the galaxy 'a small cloud' in his book, the ''Book of Fixed Stars'', which was published in 964 AD.

In 1751 William Herschel estimated the distance to the Andromeda 'nebula' as 'no more than 2000 times the distance to Sirius, or around 17,200 light years.2000 x 8.5 = 17,200  The best modern estimate of Andromeda's distance is 2.54 million light years.

Andromeda was known to the ancients, but only in the 1920s was it understood as a galaxy.

 Andromeda galaxy in fiction 
 ''A for Andromeda'': a 1961 BBC science fiction drama series written by astronomer Fred Hoyle and John Elliott, and broadcast by BBC TV in seven episodes. Remade in 2006 as a film.
 ''The Andromeda Breakthrough'' was a BBC 1962 sequel written by Fred Hoyle and John Elliott.
 ''Andromeda'' (TV series). A Canadian/American science fiction television series, based on unused material by Gene Roddenberry, and developed by Robert Hewitt Wolfe.
