 Elements numbered in blue are liquids at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP);
 those in green are gases at Standard Temperature and Pressure|STP;
 those in black are solid at Standard Temperature and Pressure|STP;
 those in red are Synthetic element|synthetic (all are solid at Standard Temperature and Pressure|STP).
 those in gray have not yet been discovered (they also have muted filled colors indicating the likely chemical series they would fall under).
