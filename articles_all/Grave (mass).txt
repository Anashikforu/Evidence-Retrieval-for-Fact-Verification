'''Grave''', shortened as ''gv'',
In order to have full consistency in the International System of Units (SI), many people think that the kilogram should be called something different. Using the word ''kilogram'' creates a problem because it is a base unit that has the prefix "kilo" already in its name. To fix the problem, some people have suggested using the word ''grave'' again.
