'''Kinetic theory''' or ''kinetic theory of gases'' attempts to explain macroscopic|overall properties of gases, such as pressure, temperature, or volume, by considering their molecule|molecular composition (natural science)|composition and motion (physics)|motion. The theory basically states that pressure is not caused by molecules repulsion|pushing each other away, like earlier scientists thought. Instead, pressure is caused by the molecules colliding with each other and their container. Kinetic theory is also known as ''kinetic-molecular theory'' or ''collision theory''.

There are three main components to kinetic theory:
 No energy is gained or lost when molecules collide
 The molecules in a gas take up a negligible (able to be ignored) amount of space in relation to the container they occupy
 The molecules are in constant, linear motion.
