 History and name 

Fugging (which was Fucking at the time) has existed since at least 1070 and is named after a man from the 6th century called "Fuko".  In old Germanic languages|Germanic, "-ing" is used to describe people as belonging to their leader; so "Fucking" means "(place of) Fukoâ€™s people."
Although the village has a population of 104 , it has drawn attention in the English-speaking world for its name, which is spelled the same as the continuous tense|continuous form of the profanity|profane English-language verb "fuck".

Fucking's most famous feature is a traffic sign with its name on it, which tourists often photograph. This street sign is often stolen.
In 2004, because many signs had been stolen, a vote was held to change the village name, but the villagers voted not to change. In August 2005, the road signs were welding|welded to a very strong pole. This made it more difficult to steal them.

Fucking changed its name to Fugging, the name change came to affect on 1 January 2021.
