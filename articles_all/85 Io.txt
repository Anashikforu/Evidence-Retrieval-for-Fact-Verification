'''85 Io''' is a big, dark Asteroid belt|Main belt asteroid of the C-type asteroid|C spectral class. It is probably a primitive body made of carbonates. Like 70 Panopaea it orbits within the Eunomia family|Eunomia asteroid family but it is not related to the shattered parent body.

Io is a Prograde and retrograde motion|retrograde rotator, with its pole pointing towards one of ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (-45°, 105°) or (-15°, 295°) with a 10° uncertainty#Torppa2003|1. This gives an axial tilt of about 125° or 115°, respectively. Its shape is quite Sphere|spherical.

It was found by Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters|C. H. F. Peters on September 19, 1865 and named after Io (mythology)|Io, a lover of Zeus in Greek mythology.

A diameter of 178 kilometres was measured from an occultation of a star on December 10, 1995 #Erikson99|4.

Io (moon)|Io is also the name of the volcanic Satellite (natural)|moon of Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter. With a two-digit number and a two-letter name, 85 Io has the shortest designation of all minor planets.
