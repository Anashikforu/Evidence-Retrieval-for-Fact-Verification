In Christianity, the '''disciples''' were the students of Jesus during his Ministry of Jesus|ministry, which sometimes means only the Twelve Apostles, but the gospels speaks of different numbers of disciples.  In the Acts of the Apostles|Book of Acts, the Apostles themselves have disciples. The word ''disciple'' is used today as a way of self-identification for those who seek to learn from Christianity.

The term '''disciple''' comes from the Ancient Greek language word
'''',
coming to English language|English by way of the Latin ''discipulus''.  ''Disciple'' should not be confused with ''apostle'', meaning
'''' While a disciple is one who learns from a teacher, a student, an apostle is sent to deliver those teachings to others.

 Disciples of Jesus of Nazareth 
=The four=
Both the gospels of Gospel of Mark|Mark ( also includes an initial calling of disciples, but these are: an unnamed disciple, Andrew, Simon, Philip the Apostle|Philip and Nathanael.

Since the Gospel of Luke does not include Andrew, and through various passages in the four gospels where Simon Peter, James and John are called to meet with Jesus separately from the twelve, they are commonly termed "the three." The usage of "the four" over "the three" is still a point which some Christians debate, but never as an essential doctrinal point.

=The twelve=

Most of the attention in the gospels is given to a specific group of disciples called by Jesus on the top of a mountain and commissioned by him as the Twelve Apostles.  These men are:

# Simon, called Saint Peter|Peter
# Saint Andrew|Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter
# James, son of Zebedee|James (called the son of Zebedee by Mark and Matthew)
# John the Apostle|John (Mark and Matthew identify him as the brother of James, son of Zebedee)
# Philip the Apostle|Philip
# Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew, named Nathanael in John
# Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew (whom the Matthew evangelist identifies as a publican), named Levi in Luke and Mark
# Thomas the Apostle|Thomas
# James, son of Alphaeus|James, the son of Alphaeus
# Simon the Zealot|Simon, called a zealot in Mark, Matthew, and Luke
# Judas Iscariot
# Jude the Apostle|Jude Thaddaeus, called Thaddaeus by Mark, Lebbaeus Thaddaeus by Matthew, and Judas, brother of James by Luke
 Paul the Apostle|Paul became an apostle after Jesus' death and resurrection.

The Gospel of John refers to one disciple as the Disciple whom Jesus loved|one whom Jesus loved.  Since the apostle John, unlike the other twelve, is never named in that gospel, the "beloved disciple" is assumed to be him.

=Great crowd and the seventy=

The number of or persons among Jesus' disciples is not always given in the gospel accounts.  A much larger group of people is identified as disciples in the opening of the passage of the Sermon on the Plain that begins in Gospel of Luke|Luke .

Additionally, seventy (or seventy-two, depending on the source used) people are sent out in pairs to prepare the way for Jesus (Luke 10).  They are sometimes referred to as "the Seventy" or "the Seventy Disciples".  They are to eat any food offered, heal the sick and spread the word; that Kingdom of God|God's reign is coming, that whoever hears them hears Jesus, whoever rejects them rejects Jesus and whoever rejects Jesus rejects the One who sent him. In addition they are granted great powers over the enemy and their names are written in heaven.

=Road to Emmaus=
Cleophas|Cleopas is one of the two disciples to whom the Resurrection appearances of Jesus|risen Lord appeared at Emmaus (Luke 24:18). Cleopas, with an unnamed disciple of Jesus' are walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus on the day of Jesus' resurrection. Cleopas and his friend were discussing the events of the past few days when a stranger asked them what they spoke of.  The stranger asked to join Cleopas and his friend for the evening meal.  There the stranger revealed himself, after blessing and breaking the bread, as the resurrected Jesus and then disappeared. Cleopas and his friend hastened to Jerusalem to carry the news to the other disciples, where Jesus subsequently appeared to them as well. The incident is without parallel in Matthew, Mark, or John.

=Women=

In Luke (10:38–42), Mary, sister of Lazarus is contrasted with her sister Martha, who was "cumbered about many things" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen "the better part," that of listening to the master's discourse.  John names her as the "one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair" (11:2).  In Luke, an unidentified "sinner" in the house of a Pharisee anoints Jesus' feet.  Any pre-existing relationship between Jesus and Lazarus himself, prior to the miracle, is unspecified by John.  In Catholic folklore, Mary, the sister of Lazarus, is seen as the same as Mary Madgalene.

Luke refers to a number of people accompanying Jesus and the twelve.  From among them he names three women: "Mary Magdalene|Mary, called Magdalene, ... and Saint Joanna|Joanna the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and Susanna (disciple)|Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their resources" (Luke 8:2-3).  Mary Magdalene and Joanna are among the women who went to prepare Jesus' body in Luke's account of the resurrection, and who later told the apostles and other disciples about the empty tomb and words of the "two men in dazzling clothes".  Mary Magdalene is the most well-known of the disciples outside of the Twelve.  More is written in the gospels about her than the other female followers.  There is also a large body of lore and literature covering her.

Other gospel writers differ as to which women witness the crucifixion and witness to the resurrection.  Mark includes Mary Jacobe|Mary, the mother of James and Salome (disciple)|Salome (not to be confused with Salomé the daughter of Herodias) at the crucifixion and Salome at the tomb.  John includes Mary, the wife of Cleopas|Mary the wife of Clopas at the crucifixion.
