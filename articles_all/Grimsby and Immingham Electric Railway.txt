The '''Grimsby & Immingham Electric Railway''' was an electric tramway network linking the township of Great Grimsby|Grimsby and the then village of Immingham in Lincolnshire.
It is probably best described by the American term "Inter-Urban" as it links the places in its title by a reserved way rather than through the streets.
