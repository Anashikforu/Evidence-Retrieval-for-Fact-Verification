The term '''Far East''' means countries of East Asia and Southeast Asia.
Before World War I, the ''Near East'' meant relatively nearby lands of the Ottoman Empire, ''Middle East'' northwestern South Asia and Central Asia, and ''Far East'' countries along the western Pacific Ocean and countries along the eastern Indian Ocean. Many European languages have analogous terms, such as the French language|French ''''. 

''Far East'' is never used for the culturally Western nations of Australia and New Zealand, which lie even farther to the east of Europe than much of East Asia.
