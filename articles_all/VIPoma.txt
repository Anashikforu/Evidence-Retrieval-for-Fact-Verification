A '''VIPoma'''  (Pronounced "V I P oma") (also called '''Verner Morrison syndrome''' after the doctors who first noticed it), is a tumor that does not happen a lot (1 per 10,000,000 per year) in the pancreas.
Treatment
Octreotide (a somatostatin analogue) can be used to help symptoms. Surgery is the only thing that will make it go away completely.
