A '''digraph''', '''bigraph''', or '''digram''' (from the , ''dís'', "double" and γράφω, ''gráphō'', "write") is a string of two letters where the number of written characters does not match the number of sounds that are spoken. In other words, two Grapheme|graphemes (units of writing, or Letter|letters) are used to represent one phoneme (distinct sound). For example, since there are no single letters in English alphabet to represent the sounds /ʃ/, /tʃ/, and /θ/, English uses a string of two letters to represent the sounds in the same order ''sh'', ''ch'', and ''th.'' While other sounds such as /f/ and /w/ already have letters that correspond to the sounds, ''f'' and ''w'', digraphs ''ph'' and ''wh'' are used in some words to show their Etymology|etymologies (origins of words) rather than their current pronunciation.
