The '''Vogelsberg Mountains''' are a group of low mountains in central Germany. They are in the middle of the state of Hessen. They are the product of ancient volcano|volcanic activity and are separated from the Rhön|Rhön Mountains by the Fulda River and its valley.

The Vogelsberg is about 19 million years old. It is Germany's only volcano|shield volcano. It is the largest basalt formation of Central Europe. It consists of many layers which fall downward from their peak in ring-shaped terraces to the base.

The highest mountains of the Vogelsberg are Taufstein, 773 m (2,536&nbsp;ft), and Hoherodskopf, 763 m (2,503&nbsp;ft). Both are now in a national park, the Hoher Vogelsberg Nature Reserve.
