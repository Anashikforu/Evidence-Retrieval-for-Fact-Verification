'''Phototrophs''' (''photo'' = light, ''troph'' = nutrition) or '''photoautotrophs''' are organisms which carry out photosynthesis. 

With their plastids and the help of energy from light|sunlight, carbon dioxide and water are converted into sugar by photosynthesis. Sugar is then converted into other Organic chemistry|organic molecules which can be used in cell (biology)|cellular functions. Such a function might be, for example, respiration.
