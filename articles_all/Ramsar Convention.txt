The '''Ramsar Convention''' ('''The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat''') is an international treaty to protect wetlands.
Convention
The convention was developed and agreed to by 18 nations at a meeting in Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar on February 2, 1971. It came into force on December 21, 1975.

The Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance now includes 2,429 sites, which are called ''Ramsar Sites'', covering around 254,611,076 hectares. This has increased from 1,021 sites in 2000. The nation with the most sites is the United Kingdom at 168. The nation with the greatest area of listed wetlands is Canada, with over 130,000&nbsp;km², including the Queen Maud Gulf Migratory Bird Sanctuary at 62,800&nbsp;km².
There are now 159 nations that have agreed to the convention. The nations meet every three years as the Conference of the Contracting Parties (COP). The first meeting was held in Cagliari, Italy, in 1980. Changes to the original convention have been agreed to in Paris (1982) and Regina (1987).
There is a standing committee, a scientific review panel, and a secretariat. The headquarters is in Gland, Switzerland, shared with the IUCN.
