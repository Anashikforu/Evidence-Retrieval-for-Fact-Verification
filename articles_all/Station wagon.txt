The '''station wagon''', or '''estate''', is a variant of Sedan (automobile)|sedan. The difference between station wagons and regular sedans is that the station wagon has no trunk, plus the roofs are extended backwards over a shared passenger or cargo volume with access in the back. 

Station wagons have been mostly replaced by minivans/MPVs, SUVs, and crossovers.
