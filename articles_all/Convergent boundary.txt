A '''convergent plate boundary''' is the boundary that occur when two plates collide each other either a continental plate with continental plate or oceanic plate. The Himalayas were formed by such a collision.  Earthquakes and volcanoes are common near convergent boundaries. This is because of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the Mantle (geology)|mantle.




The diagram shows some differences between the two types of subduction. 
# Oceanic crust moves under. A deep ocean trench forms at the coast, and an arc of mountainous volcanoes forms inland. Seen along the west edge of the Americas.
# Continental crust moves under. The edge of the continental plate folds into a huge mountain range. Behind it is a high plateau. The Himalayas and the Tibetan plateau are a perfect example of this.
