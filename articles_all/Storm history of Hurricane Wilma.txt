The '''meteorology|meteorological history of Hurricane Wilma''', the strongest tropical cyclone known in the Western Hemisphere, began in the second week of October 2005. A big weather system formed across much of the Caribbean Sea and slowly organized to the southeast of Jamaica. By late on October 15, the system was became strong for the National Hurricane Center to name it Tropical depression|Tropical Depression Twenty-Four.

The depression slowly moved southwestward, and in conditions that were good for strengthening, it tropical cyclogenesis|strengthened into Tropical Storm ''Wilma'' on October 17. In the beginning, development was slow because of its large size, although convection#Atmospheric convection|thunderstorms slowly organized. From October 18, and over the next day, Wilma underwent rapid deepening|explosive deepening over the open waters of the Caribbean; in a 30-hour period, the system's central atmospheric pressure dropped from 982&nbsp;bar (unit)|mbar (29.00&nbsp;inch of mercury|inHg) to the record-low value of 882&nbsp;mbar (26.05&nbsp;inHg), while the winds increased to 185&nbsp;mph (300&nbsp;km/h). At its strongest, the eye (cyclone)|pinhole eye of Wilma was about 3&nbsp;miles (5&nbsp;km) in diameter, the smallest known eye in an Atlantic hurricane. After the inner eye died off because of an eye (cyclone)|eyewall replacement cycle, Wilma weakened to Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4 status, and on October 21, it made Landfall (meteorology)|landfall on Cozumel and on the Mexico|Mexican mainland with winds of about 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h).

Wilma weakened over the Yucatán Peninsula, and reached the southern Gulf of Mexico before speeding up northeastward. Despite increasing amounts of wind shear, the hurricane re-strengthened to hit Cape Romano, Florida as a major hurricane. Wilma weakened as it quickly crossed the state, and entered the Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter, Florida. The hurricane again re-intensified before cold air and wind shear penetrated the inner core of convection. On October 26, it turned into an extratropical cyclone, and the next day, the remnants of Wilma were absorbed by another extratropical storm over Atlantic Canada.

Formation

The origin of Hurricane Wilma is complicated. During the second week of October, an unusually large, monsoon-like lower-level circulation and a large area of disturbed weather developed over much of the Caribbean Sea. The system was enhanced by diffluence—the rate at which a fluid moves—from an upper-level low across the southwestern Atlantic.

Later on October 14, the system became much better organized, with increasingly organized shower and thunderstorm activity, as conditions in the upper levels of the atmosphere became significantly more favorable. It was then that the National Hurricane Center first said that it was possible for a tropical depression to develop in the area. By late on October 15, the surface circulation became defined well-enough, with enough organized deep convection, for the National Hurricane Center to designate the system as ''Tropical Depression Twenty-Four'' while it was about 220&nbsp;miles (345&nbsp;km) east-southeast of Grand Cayman.

The depression tracked slowly westward, a motion due to weak steering currents caused by a ridge (meteorology)|high pressure system to its north across the Gulf of Mexico. Initially, the center of circulation was broad without a defined inner core; forecaster Lixion Avila remarked, "The area of minimum pressure could have been anywhere within 60&nbsp;miles (95&nbsp;km) of its initial advisory position." Originally, the tropical depression was forecast to drift west-southwestward before turning to the north; within 120&nbsp;hours of the forecast's issuance, the system was predicted to be about 80&nbsp;miles (130&nbsp;km) south of the Isle of Youth as a 105&nbsp;mph (170&nbsp;km/h) hurricane. However, the National Hurricane Center noted in the first advisory on the depression that there were "all indications that there could a dangerous hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean Sea in 3 to 5 days." This was due to the depression being in an environment very ideal for tropical cyclogenesis|development, specifically low amounts of wind shear and very warm sea surface temperature|water temperatures.

As Tropical Depression Twenty-Four drifted southwestward, it steadily organized; by early on October 16, tropical cyclone#Physical structure|rainbands began to slowly consolidate with well-established tropical cyclone#Physical structure|outflow, and a large upper-level anticyclone developed over the depression.

Peak strength

By early on October 17, the outer rainbands, which had previously controlled the structure of the cyclone, dissipated, while deep convection developed near and to the south of the center. Computer models predicted steady strengthening as the depression moved westward before turning to the north. Of the intensity models, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory predicted an intensity of 135&nbsp;mph (215&nbsp;km/h) within 36&nbsp;hours, with other forecasts being more conservative in their predictions.

Tropical Storm Wilma began to turn to the west-northwest on October 18, during which the storm developed a small, intermittent and ragged eye (cyclone)|eye feature as well as a mid-level eye feature.

Early on October 19, Wilma attained Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|major hurricane status while continuing to rapidly intensify, and by 0600 UTC, the storm's maximum sustained winds increased to 170&nbsp;mph (275&nbsp;km/h), making Wilma a dangerous Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. In the span of just 24 hours, Wilma had intensified from a 70-mph (110-km/h) tropical storm to a 175-mph (280-km/h) Category 5 hurricane, an event that has never happened before for an Atlantic hurricane. The eye continued to contract to a diameter of about 3&nbsp;miles (5&nbsp;km), the smallest known eye in an Atlantic hurricane, and at 1200&nbsp;UTC on October 19, Wilma reached peak winds of 185&nbsp;mph (300&nbsp;km/h). The central pressure quickly dropped 54&nbsp;mbar (1.65&nbsp;inHg) from 0000 to 0600&nbsp;UTC.

At 0800&nbsp;UTC, a Hurricane Hunters flight recorded a minimum central pressure of 884&nbsp;mbar (26.10&nbsp;inHg) in a dropsonde near the center of the extremely small eye. As the dropsonde did not reach the calm winds in the center, the pressure was estimated at 882&nbsp;mbar (26.05&nbsp;inHg), the lowest pressure in an Atlantic hurricane on record. The pressure continued to fall as the Hurricane Hunters left the hurricane, and it is possible the pressure was a little bit lower. Operationally, the peak intensity was estimated at 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h).

First landfall
Shortly after peaking in intensity, the coldest cloud tops surrounding the eye warmed a little bit and an outer eyewall began to form, meaning that an eye (cyclone)#Eyewall replacement cycles|eyewall replacement cycle was happening. By late on October 19, the winds in Hurricane Wilma decreased to 160&nbsp;mph (260&nbsp;km/h) as the inner 5&nbsp;mile (8&nbsp;km) wide eye weakened and the wind field expanded. though Wilma remained a strong Category 4 hurricane as it tracked northwestward.

Steering currents stayed weak, though a series of trough (meteorology)|troughs eroded the high pressure system across the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in a turn towards the north-northwest. Environmental conditions remained favorable, with the eye becoming more distinct early on October 21.

Second landfall and demise
On October 22, the mid-level ridge (meteorology)|ridge to the north of Wilma later dissipated, leaving the hurricane moving northward across the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula. As the hurricane moved farther inland, the eye became cloud-filled as the deepest convection began to warm, and the winds slowly weakened during its passage over land.

A powerful eastward-moving mid-level trough across the central United States turned the hurricane northeastward and caused it to gradually speed up. Vertical wind shear increased as strong upper-level southwesterly flow increased, though in spite of the shear Wilma continued to intensify. Early on October 24, Wilma re-gained Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|major hurricane status while about 120&nbsp;miles (195&nbsp;km) west-southwest of Key West, Florida|Key West, Florida. It slowly became better organized, with the large 50&nbsp;mile (80&nbsp;km) eye becoming very distinct on satellite and radar imagery. Wilma was able to retain its strength because large eyes in tropical cyclones are more stable and more resistant to vertical wind shear. Despite wind shear values of about 30&nbsp;mph (48&nbsp;km/h), Wilma strengthened further to reach winds of 125&nbsp;mph (200&nbsp;km/h). It weakened a little bit as it approached Florida, and made landfall at Cape Romano with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) at around 1030&nbsp;UTC on October 24.

Hurricane Wilma crossed the Florida peninsula in about 4.5&nbsp;hours while continuing to speed northeastward, and entered into the Atlantic Ocean as a weakened 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h) hurricane near Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter. A vigorous cold front associated with the mid-level trough moved across the area to the west of Wilma, yet the cooler and drier air behind the front could not fully penetrate the inner core of the hurricane to weaken it. Shortly after exiting the Florida coastline, Wilma began to re-intensify, believed to be due to a reduction of friction of the eyewall and warm waters of the Gulf Stream. The remaining convection continued to diminish, and early on October 26 Wilma turned into an extratropical cyclone while about 230&nbsp;miles (370&nbsp;km) southeast of Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia. The extratropical remnant continued east-northeast before being absorbed by another extratropical storm on October 27.
