Image:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|right|270px|Three types of plate boundary.
The major types of '''plate boundaries''' are:
# Divergent boundary|Spreading boundaries. Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Africa's Great Rift Valley are examples. Rift valleys, mountains (orogeny), volcanoes.
# Convergent boundary|Collision boundaries. These collide, forming a subduction zone (West coast of the Americas) or a continental collision (India with Asia). Mountains (orogeny), valleys, volcanoes.
# Transform or Fault (geology)|fault boundaries. Here plates grind past each other along transform faults. Earthquakes, volcanoes, 
# Conservative boundaries: little or no relative motion

All boundaries except the conservative ones are sites of major geological activity.
