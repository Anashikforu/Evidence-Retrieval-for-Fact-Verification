'''S/2007 S 2''' is an unnamed Satellite (natural)|moon of Saturn (planet)|Saturn. Its discovery was announced by Scott S. Sheppard, David C. Jewitt, Jan Kleyna, and Brian G. Marsden on May 1, 2007, from observations taken between January 18 and April 19, 2007. Telescope used is the Subaru Telescope|Subaru 8.3-m optical infrared telescope at Mauna Kea.

 Overview 
S/2007 S2 is theorized to have a mean radius of 1.9 miles, assuming an albedo of 0.04. It is 6 kilometres in diameter and orbits Saturn at an Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity of about 0.218 and an inclination of about 176.68Â° at a mean distance of 10.4 million miles (average distance of 16,560,00 million kilometres) from Saturn. The Natural satellite|satellite takes about 808 Earth days to complete one Orbital period|orbit.

Like Saturn's other irregular moons, S/2007 S2 is thought to be an object that was captured by Saturn|Saturn's gravity, rather than having accreted from the dusty disk that surrounded the newly formed planet as the regular Natural satellite|satellites are thought to have done.
