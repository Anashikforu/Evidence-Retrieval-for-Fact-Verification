The '''largest extinct animals''' known to date are listed here. They are arranged by their taxonomy (classification). The list only deals with individual animals; size of Colony (biology)|colonies (such as coral reefs) is not dealt with here.

 Vertebrates 
= Fish =
 Bony fish
The largest bony fish of all time was ''Leedsichthys problematicus'' from the Middle Jurassic, at around  long. Chondrichthyes|Cartilaginous fish


The extinct megatoothed shark, Megalodon|''C. megalodon'' is by far the biggest and most powerful shark that ever lived.

= Reptiles =
 Turtles 
The largest fossil turtle seems to be the freshwater turtle ''Stupendemys'', with an estimated total carapace length of more than 11&nbsp;feet (3.3&nbsp;metres). A close contender is ''Archelon ischyros'', a sea turtle, which reached a length of 16&nbsp;feet (4.8&nbsp;m) across the flippers and a weight of over 4,850&nbsp;lb (2,200&nbsp;kg).World's largest sea turtle. Black Hills Institute of Geological Research. 
 Archosaurs 
 Crocodiles
While often suggested to be the largest crocodilian, ''Sarcosuchus imperator'' has been recently cut down to 4 tonnes in weight and 9 meters in length. 

 Pterosaurs 
The largest pterosaur was ''Quetzalcoatlus northropi'', at 127&nbsp;kg (280&nbsp;lbs) and with a wingspan of 11&nbsp;m (36&nbsp;ft). Another close contender is ''Hatzegopteryx'', also with a wingspan of 11&nbsp;m (this estimate is based on a skull 3&nbsp;m long (10&nbsp;ft).Witton M.P. and Naish D. 2008. A reappraisal of Azhdarchid pterosaur functional morphology and paleoecology. ''PLoS ONE'', '''3'''(5): e2271.  
 Dinosaurs 
 '''Sauropods'''

Titanosaurs hold the world record for the size of a land animal. A recent discovery in the Argentine found ''Dreadnoughtus'', an estimated length of 26 metres (85 feet) and weight of 59,291 kilogram|kg (65.4 short tons). Its bones showed it was a sub-adult.Benson, Roger B.J. ''et al'' 2014. Rates of dinosaur body mass evolution indicate 170 million years of sustained ecological innovation on the avian stem lineage. ''PLOS Biology''. 
A notably large titanosaurid is ''Argentinosaurus'', which is known from partially preserved remains. This sauropod has been estimated as  long and 73–99 metric tons in weight.

 '''Ornithopods'''


The very largest ornithopods, like ''Shantungosaurus'' were as heavy as medium-sized sauropods at up to 23 metric tons ''Lambeosaurus|Lambeosaurus laticaudus'' appears to be close contender at around  in length.

 '''Theropods'''
The largest known theropod is ''Spinosaurus|Spinosaurus aegyptiacus'', estimated at  in length and around 7–9 metric tons in weight. ''Spinosaurus aegyptiacus'' is also recognized as the largest terrestrial predator yet known.

A close contender in size is a giant theropod from South America, ''Giganotosaurus carolinii'', whose holotype specimen is estimated at  in length, tall at hips,
and weighing up to 16,000 Pound (mass)|pounds. The largest Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurid is ''Utahraptor''. In addition to being the largest known dromaeosaurid, it was also the largest known Deinonychosauria|deinonychosaur and the largest known Paraves|paravian.
 '''Thyreophora|Armoured dinosaurs'''
The largest thyreophoran was ''Ankylosaurus'' at  in length and 6.5 tons in weight.Vickaryous M.K; Maryanska T & Weishampel D.B. 2004. Ankylosauria. In:  Weishampel D.B; Dodson P. & Osmólska H. (eds) ''The Dinosauria'' (2nd edition). Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 363-392. ''Stegosaurus'' was also 9&nbsp;meters (30&nbsp;ft) long but around 5 tons in weight.
 '''Ceratopsia'''
The largest ceratopsian known is probably the newly discovered ''Eotriceratops'' with a skull alone being  in length and 13 tonnes in weight.

 Ichthyosaurs 
The largest ichthyosaur was ''Shonisaurus sikanniensis'' at ~21&nbsp;metres (70&nbsp;ft) in length. This would make it the largest extinct marine animal.

 Plesiosaurs 
 Long-necked plesiosauridae
The largest plesiosaur was ''Mauisaurus haasti'', growing to about 20&nbsp;metres (66&nbsp;ft) in length. Next behind was ''Elasmosaurus'' at 14&nbsp;metres (46&nbsp;ft) long.
 Pliosaurs
There is much controversy here. Fossil remains of a pliosaur nicknamed ''Predator X'' were excavated from Norway in 2008. It was about  in length and 41 metric tons in weight. Some media claimed that ''Monster of Aramberri'' was a ''Liopleurodon'' this is unconfirmed.

 Squamata 
 Snakes
The largest known prehistoric snake is ''Titanoboa'', estimated at  in length and 1135&nbsp;kg–1819&nbsp;kg in weight.
 Mosasaurs
Giant mosasaurs are the largest animals in the Squamata. The largest known mosasaur is likely ''Mosasaurus|Mosasaurus hoffmanni'', estimated at least  in length.

= Birds  =

The largest birds of all time might have been the elephant birds of Madagascar. Of almost the same size was the Australian ''Dromornis stirtoni''. Both were about 3&nbsp;m tall (10&nbsp;ft). The elephant birds were up to 400&nbsp;kg and ''Dromornis'' was up to 500&nbsp;kg in weight. The tallest bird ever was the Giant Moa (''Dinornis maximus'') at 12&nbsp;ft tall.

The largest flight-capable bird was ''Argentavis magnificens'' which had a wingspan of 7&nbsp;m (~23&nbsp;ft), and a body weight of 110&nbsp;kg (244&nbsp;lb), or ''Pelagornis|Pelagornis sandersi'' with a wingspan of 6.4 to 7.4 metres.Morelle, Rebecca (July 7, 2014). "Fossil of 'largest flying bird' identified". BBC News. 
= Mammals =
 Whales 

''Basilosaurus'' was once recognized as one of the largest known extinct cetaceans at  in length.

The largest fossil toothed whale was the Miocene whale ''Livyatan melvillei'' which was estimated to be  in length.


However, the largest fossil whales were baleen whales (plankton feeders) from the Pliocene and Pleistocene Epochs.
 A notable example is the bones of a Pliocene age baleen whale, assigned the questionable name "''Balaenoptera sibbaldina''", which likely rivaled the modern blue whale in size.

 Land mammals 

The largest Perissodactyla|perissodactyl, and land mammal, of all time was ''Palaeoloxodon namadicus''. It stood 5.5&nbsp;m (18&nbsp;ft) tall at the shoulder, with a total height of 8&nbsp;m (27&nbsp;ft). It was 12&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;ft) long and may have weighed 20 tonnes (22 tons), though mass estimates vary. Some prehistoric horned Rhinoceros|rhinos also grew to large sizes. The giant woolly rhino ''Elasmotherium'' reached 20&nbsp;ft long and 6.6&nbsp;ft high.

 Invertebrates 
= Myriapoda =
 Millipedes (Diplopoda) 
The largest by far was the giant ''Arthropleura''. Measuring 2.5&nbsp;metres (8.2&nbsp;ft) and 45 centimetres (18&nbsp;in) wide, it was the largest terrestrial arthropod of all time.
