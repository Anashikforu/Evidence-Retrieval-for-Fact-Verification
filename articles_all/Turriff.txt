'''Turriff''' is a town and parish in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It is approximately 166 feet above sea level. It is known locally as '''Turra''' in the Doric dialect (Scotland)|Doric dialect of Scots language|Scots. The name appears to be Scottish Gaelic in origin, from "''torr''" meaning a mound or round hill, or "''tur''" meaning a tower.

 History 


The Knights Templar appear to have had a base in the area, and a nearby site is still known as "Temple Brae".

Early in 1639, the Marquess of Huntly|Marquis of Huntly assembled his forces here, and thereafter went to Kintore, Scotland|Kintore in lower Aberdeenshire, eventually marching from there to Aberdeen itself. The Marquis — being informed shortly after his arrival in Aberdeen that a meeting of Covenanters was to be held in Turriff on the fourteenth of February — resolved to disperse them, by occupying the town with 2000 men. The incident was known as the "First raid of Turray".
