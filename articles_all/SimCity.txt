'''''SimCity''''' is a Video game|computer game where the player has to build a city. They can do whatever they want to their city. It can be built from the ground up or it can be destroyed by a tropical cyclone|hurricane or a UFO.

History
''Sim City'' was made by game maker Will Wright and first released by the company Maxis. They are now owned by Electronic Arts. The game was first officially released in 1989.

It was very popular because the game had no end. A player could not win or lose. This was the start of all simulation games.

Gameplay
At the start, the player has to build power station|power plants. Power plants make power so the city can have electricity. By building Power line|power lines, power is connected to the different areas of the city. Water needs to be pumped in from a river using water pipes|pipes to connect them to the city.

Smaller areas are marked out. These are made either residential, commerce|commercial, or factory|industrial zones. Zones are the only places where buildings can develop. Every city needs the right amount of each zone otherwise the city will not grow.

Roads, schools and hospitals must all be built for the city to get better. Parks and Library|libraries make more people want to move to the city. Railways and Highway|highways provide ways to connect to other neighborhoods.
