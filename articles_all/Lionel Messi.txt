Messi began football at a young age and his potential was quickly seen by Barcelona. He left Newell's Old Boys' youth team in September 2000 and moved with his family to Europe in February 2001. He officially signed with Barcelona in December 2000 on a napkin. They moved to Spain because Barcelona offered their help to treat his growth hormone deficiency, and Newell's didn't offer any help.

Messi played his first professional match at 16 years old on 16 November 2003 against FC Porto|Porto. He played the 2003-04 season with Barcelona B.
