'''Arsenic pentoxide''', also known as '''arsenic(V) oxide''', is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is As2O5. It has arsenic and oxide ions in it. The arsenic is in its +5 oxidation state. More common is arsen in its oxidation state +3 as As2O3 (arsenic trioxide or arsenic(III) oxide). The LD50 for arsenic pentoxide is 8mg/kg for rats. When the substance becomes wet, it turns into arsenic acid, which corrodes metals.

Properties
Arsenic pentoxide is a white, odourless solid. 
:As_2O_5 + 268.1 kJ \rightarrow As_2O_3 + O_2

It reacts with base (chemistry)|bases to make arsenates. The energy for the reaction is taken from the heating.

Preparation
Arsenic pentoxide cannot be produced by burning arsen. That only results in As2O3. To produce arsenic pentoxid, arsenic acid will be dehydration|dehydrated. This is done with phosphorus(V) oxide.

:2 H_3AsO_4 \rightleftharpoons As_2O_5 + 3 H_2O

The arsenic pentoxide drops out as white powder.

Uses
Arsenic pentoxide is used to make pesticides and insecticides. It is also used in glass industry.
