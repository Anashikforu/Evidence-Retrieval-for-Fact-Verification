The '''Flag of Thailand''' has five stripes red, white, and blue. Red-white-blue stand for nation-religion-king, an unofficial motto of Thailand. The flag was made official on 28 September 1917 by a royal decree. The Thai name for the flag is ธงไตรรงค์ ("Thong Trairong"), which means "tricolour flag".
