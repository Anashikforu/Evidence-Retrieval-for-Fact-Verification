'''''Quaesitosaurus''''' (meaning "abnormal or extraordinary lizard") was a huge, long-necked, whip-tailed, plant-eating dinosaur that was found in the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. ''Quaesitosaurus'' may have been about 75 feet (23&nbsp;m) long. This sauropod dinosaur lived during the late Cretaceous Period, roughly 85-80 million years ago. ''Quaesitosaurus'' may be the same as ''Nemegtosaurus''. This environment was semi-arid during the Mesozoic Era.
