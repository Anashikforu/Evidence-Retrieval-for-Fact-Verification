'''Baking powder''' is a dry chemical leavening agent used to make baking|baked foods lighter and less wikt:dense|dense. Baking powder works by making a reaction between an acid and a base. This produces carbon dioxide bubbles to make the mixture light. Baking powder was invented by the English chemist Alfred Bird  (1811 – 15 December 1878) in 1843.

It is used when the food should not taste of yeast, Because carbon dioxide is made faster by baking powder than yeast, breads made with it are called quick breads.

Most baking powders are made up of an alkaline (usually baking soda), one or two acid salts, and a starch (cornstarch or sometimes potato starch). Baking soda is where the carbon dioxide comes from,

:NaHCO3 + H+ → Na+ + CO2 + H2O

Bird was quickly followed by Henry Jones (1812 – 12 July 1891) who invented self-rising flour in 1845.
