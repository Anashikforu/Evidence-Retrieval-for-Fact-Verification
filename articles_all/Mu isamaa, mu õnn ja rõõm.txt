"'''Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm'''" (pron. mu ˈisɑ.mɑː mu ˈɤnʲ jɑ ˈrɤːm, "moo EE-sah-mah moo UHN yah RUHM"; en. 'My Fatherland, My Happiness and Joy') is the incipit of the national anthem of Estonia, first adopted in 1920.

This song has been around since the 19th century; its lyrics (words) were written in 1869 by Estonian poet Johann Voldemar Jannsen, and its melody—the same one used in Finland's national anthem "Maamme"—was composed in 1848 by Friedrich Pacius.

When the Soviet Union|Soviets took control of Estonia in 1940, this anthem was banned, then four years later when the small Baltic country became part of the Soviet Union, a Anthem of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|regional Soviet anthem was adopted. In May 1990, shortly before the Soviet Union fell, the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic was renamed the "Republic of Estonia" and this anthem was adopted again.

Lyrics
=Estonian lyrics=


=Poetic English translation=
:My native land, my joy – delight,
:How fair thou art — how bright!
:For nowhere in the world around
:Can ever such a place be found
:So well belov'd, from sense profound,
:My native country dear!

:My tiny crib stood on thy soil,
:Whose blessings eased my toil.
:May my last breath be thanks to thee,
:For true to death I'll ever be,
:O worthy, most belov'd and fine,
:Thou, dearest country mine!

:May God in Heaven thee defend,
:My own beloved land!
:May He be guard, may He be shield,
:For ever bless and guardian wield
:Protection for all deeds of thine,
:My own, my dearest land!
