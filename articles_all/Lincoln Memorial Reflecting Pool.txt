The '''Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool''' is the biggest reflecting pool in Washington, D.C. It is right next to the Lincoln Memorial.  The reflecting pool is long and can be seen in many photographs of the Washington Monument. There are paths and trees on both sides, and many people exercise around it.  It reflects both the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, which means that you can see both if you look into the water.

It holds approximately 6,750,000 U.S.&nbsp;gallons (25,500,000&nbsp;liter|L) of water.
