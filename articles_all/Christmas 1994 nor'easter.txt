The '''Christmas 1994 nor'easter''' was a strong cyclone along the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada. It developed from an area of low pressure area|low pressure in the southeast Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Keys, and moved across the state of Florida.

Meteorological history
A weather system moved towards the southeast from the central Great Plains into the Deep South of the United States. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, the weather system became a cyclone. An approaching Trough (meteorology)|trough pushed the system across Florida. A forecaster at the National Hurricane Center, Jack Beven, said that "as it the storm moved out into the Bahamas, it appeared to take on the characteristics of a tropical storm." He also noted that because of the uncertainty, the National Hurricane Center did not call the weather system a tropical cyclone.

The cyclone was said to be a "hybrid" storm. The cyclone quickly gained strength in warm waters from the Gulf Stream, and because of cold air over the United States.
