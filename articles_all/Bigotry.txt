 Etymology 
The exact origin of the word is unknown, but may have come from the German language|German ''bei'' and ''gott'', or the English ''by God''. William Camden wrote that the Normans were first called bigots, when their Duke Rollo of Normandy|Rollo, who receiving Gisla, daughter of Charles the Simple|King Charles, in marriage, and with her the investiture of the dukedom, refused to kiss the king's foot in token of subjection, unless the king would hold it out for that purpose. And being urged to it by those present, Rollo answered hastily, "No by God", whereupon the king turning about, called him ''bigot''; which name passed from him to his people. This is likely fictional, however, as Gisla is unknown in Frankish sources.
