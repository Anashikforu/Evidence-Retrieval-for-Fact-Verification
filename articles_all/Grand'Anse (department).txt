'''Grand'Anse''', or ''Grande Anse'', is one of the ten Province|departments (French language|French: ''départments'', singular ''départment'') of Haiti. Its capital is Jérémie.

 Geography 
The ''Départment de la Grand'Anse'' has an area of 2,091 Square kilometre|km². It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Gonâve, to the east by the Nippes Department, to the south by the Sud Department, and by the Caribbean Sea to the west.

The ''Massiff de la Hotte'', an important Haitian mountain range, runs from west to east along the south of the department, with the Plymouth, Macaya and Casetaches mountain ranges.
