'''Village School''' (commonly '''VS''') is the oldest public alternative high school in New York State. It was judged very good by the Center for the Study of Educational Alternatives at Hofstra University.
Village School is one of three high schools in the Great Neck School District, which includes Great Neck North High School and William A. Shine Great Neck South High School.
The alternative school provides education for grades Ninth grade|9-Twelfth grade|12.
All have at least average ability, some have exceptional learning abilities and artistic talents, while others have special educational needs. Students who may have felt lost and isolated in a large school often thrive in the smaller and more personalized setting of the Village School.

The school describes itself as a "college preparatory public high school dedicated to encouraging academic success through a non-traditional, innovative curriculum".
