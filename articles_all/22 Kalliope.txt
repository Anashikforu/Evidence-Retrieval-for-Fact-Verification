'''22 Kalliope''' is a big Asteroid belt|main belt asteroid of the M-type asteroid|M-type, found by John Russell Hind|J. R. Hind on November 16, 1852. It is named after Calliope, the Greek mythology|Greek Muse of epic poetry.

 Characteristics 
Kalliope is about 180&nbsp;km in diameter but is not perfectly round, as shown by images from the Very Large Telescope|VLT at the European Southern Observatory 
Its spectrum is M-type asteroid|M-type, but Kalliope does not appear to be metallic. It is similar to other M-types such as 21 Lutetia. Firstly, its density is far too low to be metal. Second, spectroscopic studies have shown evidence of hydration|hydrated minerals  so the surface is probably stony. Kalliope also has a low radar albedo, unlike most metallic surfaces.

Lightcurve analysis indicates that Kalliope's pole most likely points towards ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (-23°, 20°) with a 10° uncertainty, which gives Kalliope an axial tilt of 103°. Kalliope's rotation is then a bit retrograde.

 Moon 
Kalliope has one known moon, Linus (moon)|Linus, or (22) Kalliope I Linus. It is quite big: 30–40&nbsp;km in diameter. It orbits about 1065&nbsp;km from Kalliope. This is about 12 times the radius of Kalliope. Linus was found on August 29, 2001 by Jean-Luc Margot and Michael E. Brown, while another team also independently found the moon 3 days later.
