'''''Smile''''' is an unfinished album by the Beach Boys. Their leader Brian Wilson wanted the album to be the follow-up to the album ''Pet Sounds''. It was never finished because Wilson thought the public would not like it.

Later in 1967, the Beach Boys released another album called ''Smiley Smile''. The album had songs that were written for ''Smile''. ''Smiley Smile'' was not the great success that Wilson thought ''Smile'' would have been. The Beach Boys lost many wikt:fan|fans because of the album's failure.

In 2004, Brian finished a version of ''Smile''.
