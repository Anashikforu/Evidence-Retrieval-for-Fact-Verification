The '''portia tree''' (''Thespesia populnea'') Family Malvaceae, is a small tree or shrub 5-10 (-20) m high that is pantropical in littoral environments, although probably native only to the Old World. In Hawaiian Islands|Hawai‘i and elsewhere in the Pacific it is possibly indigenous, although may have been spread by early Polynesians for its useful wood and fiber.

Common names vary according to the country and include "Indian tulip tree", "Pacific rosewood", "seaside mahoe" (in Florida), ''surina'' (the "elegant tree"), ''suriya'' (Sinhalese language|Sinhala), ''bebaru'' or ''baru baru'' (Malay), ''milo'' or ''miro'' (in many Polynesian languages), ''mako‘i'' (Rapanui language|Rapanui), ''gangaraavi'' (Telugu), ''poovarasu'' (Tamil), and ''plaksa'' (Sanskrit).

Traditionally it was planted in sacred groves and used for religious sculpture throughout eastern Polynesia. It was used for the rongorongo tablets of Easter Island.Orliac, Catherine. 2005.
