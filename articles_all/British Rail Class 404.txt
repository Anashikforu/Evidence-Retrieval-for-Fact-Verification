The Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway (SR) gave the designations SR Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification|'''4Cor''', '''4Res''', '''4Buf''' and '''4Gri''' to the different types of electric multiple unit built to work the route between London Waterloo and Portsmouth Harbour. The 4Cor type units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated TOPS '''Class 404'''. The '''Cor''' designation had previously been used for the SR Class 6Pul|6Pul units and was reused by them during World War II when the Pullman car was stored, but this stock was different from the 4Cor units.
