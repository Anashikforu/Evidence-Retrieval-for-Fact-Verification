In a '''Hierarchical database model''' is a data model where the data is organised like a tree (computing)|tree. The structure allows repeating information using parent/child relationships: each parent can have many children but each child only has one parent. All attributes of a specific record are listed under an entity type.

In a database, an entity type is the equivalent of a table; each individual record is represented as a row and an attribute as a column. Entity types are related to each other using ''1:&nbsp;N'' mapping, also known as one-to-many relationships. 

The most recognized and used hierarchical databases are Information Management System|IMS developed by International Business Machines|IBM and Windows Registry by Microsoft.
