 '''NOTICE:''' '''Simple English Wikipedia does not let users upload images (pictures or photos) anymore.''' Please read our Wikipedia:Image use policy|image use policy.

This means, if you want to use a picture file in an article on Simple English Wikipedia, you must upload it at ''':Commons:|Wikimedia Commons,''' instead of using this page.

However, if you are uploading a '''SPOKEN ARTICLE''', feel free to do so, but remember to add  to the description page so other users would not be confused.

"Commons" is the place that shares images with all the Wikimedia projects (Wikipedia, Wikibooks, Wiktionary, Wikisource, Wikiquote), in every language. Whenever a picture is placed on the Commons, it can be used here (and everywhere else, too) right away. Please read commons:Commons:First steps|Commons:First steps for more.
