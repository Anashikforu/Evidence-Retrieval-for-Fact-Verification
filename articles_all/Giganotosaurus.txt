'''''Giganotosaurus''''' is a large theropod dinosaur. It lived during the Upper Cretaceous, about 10095 million years ago in what is now Argentina. 70 percent of the skeleton has been found. ''Giganotosaurus'' was probably the second largest carnivorous dinosaur of all time. Another large carnivore, ''Mapusaurus'', also lived in the same territory. They were both relatives of the North African  ''Carcharodontosaurus''. 

The largest specimen is . 

Titanosaur fossils belonging to ''Andesaurus'' and ''Limaysaurus'' have been found near the remains of ''Giganotosaurus''. The huge titanosaur ''Argentinosaurus'' also lived in the area. Probably, the titanosaurs were the main prey of the large theropods.
