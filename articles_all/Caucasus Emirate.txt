On October 31, 2007, the Islamic nationalists news agency Chechen-press reported that the President of Ichkeria Doka Umarov had proclaimed an Emirate in the Caucasus and declared himself its Emir, thereby abolishing the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and its presidency.

However, according to Umarov, the bases of the rebel fighters loyal to him "spread from Azerbaijan to Abkhazia".
