The '''Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award''' is college football award given every year to the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision head coach whose team does well on the field, in the classroom, and in the community.  The award is named for Bobby Dodd.  Dodd was head football coach at Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech.  The award was made in 1976 to honor the values that Dodd held.  Coaches who win the award are chosen by a committee of college football experts and all previous winners.  The winner is announced during half-time of the Chick-fil-A Bowl on December 31 in Atlanta, Georgia.   A formal presentation is held later, usually on the university campus of the winner.
