History
=1981–1999: Early life and career=
Thile was born in Oceanside, California in 1981. When he was two, his family started going to ''That Pizza Place'', where he listened to John Moore's band ''Bluegrass Etc''. When Thile was four, his family moved to Idyllwild, California.

He started playing mandolin at the age of five. He took lessons from John Moore. When Thile was eight, Nickel Creek was formed. After playing many music festivals with Nickel Creek, he won the national mandolin contest at the Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, Kansas at age twelve.

In 1993, Thile was signed to the bluegrass record label Sugar Hill Records|Sugar Hill. The next year, he released his first album, ''Leading Off'', and most of the songs were written by Thile. In 1997, Thile released ''Stealing Second'' and Nickel Creek released ''Here to There''.

=2000–2005: ''Wander'' and ''Deceiver''=
After ''Nickel Creek'' sold 500,000 copies, Thile released ''Not All Who Wander Are Lost'' in 2001. The name of the album comes from a quote in J. R. R. Tolkien's book ''The Lord of the Rings''. The album had guest appearances from his Nickel Creek bandmates as well as Stuart Duncan, Béla Fleck, Edgar Meyer, Jerry Douglas, and Bryan Sutton.

In 2003, Thile and mandolinist Mike Marshall made a duet album called ''Into the Cauldron,'' which had covers by artists from Charlie Parker to Bach.

In August 2006, Nickel Creek announced in ''Billboard (magazine)|Billboard'' and on their official website that they would take an ''indefinite hiatus'', which means a break for an unknown amount of time.

Just before this, Thile formed the How to Grow a Band. He made ''How to Grow a Woman from the Ground'', with them. This was Thile's fifth album. In an interview with the ''Nashville City Paper'', Thile talked about the band's start: 

The band's members are Thile (mandolin), Gabe Witcher (fiddle), Chris Eldridge (guitar), Greg Garrison (bass), and Noam Pikelny (banjo). Bryan Sutton also played guitar for the band when Chris Eldridge could not. In 2007, the band changed its name twice: first to "The Tensions Mountain Boys" and then "Punch Brothers."
