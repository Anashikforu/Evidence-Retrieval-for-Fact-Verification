It is the part of a tree that lets the tree Sexual reproduction|reproduce. Its formal name in botany is '''strobilus''', plural ''strobili''.Images of cones 




The familiar woody cone is the female cone, which produces seeds. The male cones, which produce pollen, are usually smaller and much less conspicuous even at full maturity. The individual plates of a cone are known as scales.

The '''male cone''' ('''microstrobilus''' or '''pollen cone''') is structurally similar across all conifers, differing only in small ways (mostly in scale arrangement) from species to species. Extending out from a central axis are '''microsporophylls''' (modified leaves). Under each microsporophyll is one or several '''sporangium|microsporangia''' (pollen sacs).

Conifer cones and their seeds have been used for lots of different purposes. They are often used for wikt:decorate|decorations. Some seeds, for example, the seeds of pinyon pines, are used in prepared foods and baking. 

Most mature cones are closed when wet and open when dry. In a few species, it takes fire to open the cones.Dawson, Colin; Vincent J.F.V. & Rocca, Anne-Marie 1997. How pine cones open. ''Nature'' '''390''': 668.
