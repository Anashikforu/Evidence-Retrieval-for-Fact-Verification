History
Chapel Hill got its name from a chapel on a hill, that was around in the 1700s. In 1792, The University of North Carolina (UNC) was started, which helped Chapel Hill grow. But it was a small town until the 1950s, when it started growing faster, like the rest of The Triangle. By 1970, it had 25,000 people. Since then, Chapel Hill has been somewhat rich. The town was the place where the 2015 Chapel Hill shooting happened, which some newspapers described as Islamophobic.
