A '''line''' is the path of one point moving. A line has length but no width. A line is a type of geometry|geometric wikt:figure|figure.

A line is made up of an Infinity|endless number of point (geometry)|points.

 Straight and curved lines 

A line can be straight or curved. In geometry, the word ''line'' means a ''straight line''. A straight line is the shortest distance between two point (geometry)|points. A straight line is the line traced by a point moving in a direction that does not wikt:change|change.

A ''curved line'' is sometimes called a curve. The edge of a circle is not straight and is an example of a curve.

 Line segments 
A ''line segment'' is part of a line. Here is an example of a straight line segment:

 Naming lines 
Lines can get their names from any two points on the line. For example, if a line contains two distinct points, named A and B, then the line can be called either \overleftrightarrow{AB}, or \overleftrightarrow{BA}.

Sometimes, lines are also named with just one symbol. In which case, a letter such as \ell might be used.

 Two lines 
Two lines can be:
 parallel (geometry)|Parallel: Two lines are parallel if they are on the same plane and they never touch.
 Concurrent: Two lines are concurrent if they touch on one point.
 Coincident: Two lines are coincident if they are made of the same points.
 Perpendicular: Two lines are perpendicular if they make four right angles where they touch.
 Skew lines|Skew: In Euclidean space, two lines are skew if they are not parallel but they never touch.
