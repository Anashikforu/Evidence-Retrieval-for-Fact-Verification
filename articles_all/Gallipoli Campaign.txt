The '''Gallipoli Campaign''' or the '''Dardanelles Campaign''' and the '''Battle of Gallipoli''' was an Allies of World War I|Allied attack on the Gallipoli|Gallipoli peninsula during World War I. The campaign took place between April 25, 1915 and January 9, 1916. The Allies of World War I|Allied forces of the British Empire and of France|French fought the Ottoman Empire.

The reasons that the campaign happened were to break the stalemate on the Western Front|Western and the Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front and to help Russia.

The campaign started with a navy|naval attack along the Dardanelles. Naval mines sank or damaged several ships, and the Ottomans fought back and stopped the Allies from entering the Sea of Marmara. It was decided that if the Russians were to receive any British help, a land invasion was necessary.

On April 25, 1915, Allied forces landed at various locations along the Gallipoli Peninsula. Many British soldiers were landed in the wrong places, which caused heavy casualties. The British landed at Cape Helles and the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|ANZACs landed at a place that was later known as Anzac Cove. However, the Allies did not push on. Instead, they were told to dig trenches and wait for an Ottoman attack. There was trench warfare until the evacuation of all Allied troops was finally ordered. The campaign is widely viewed as an Allied failure.

The British historian A.J.P. Taylor wrote of the Gallipoli campaign: "The Gallipoli expedition was a terrible example of an ingenious strategical idea carried through after inadequate preparation and with inadequate drive."

Mustafa Kemal led the Ottoman defenders in what was the only important victory in the war and so he became a hero. Years after the war ended, he became the first President of Turkey. He paid tribute to the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|ANZAC soldiers who had died there.
