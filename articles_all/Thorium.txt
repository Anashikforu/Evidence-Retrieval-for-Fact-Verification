'''Thorium''' is a chemical element in actinide group. It is a weakly radioactive metal. It has a shiny, silvery white color. It has the chemical symbol '''Th''' and the atomic number 90. Natural thorium has an atomic weight of 232. Thorium is named after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Its ore|ores are found in nature, especially in India, the United States, and Australia. 

Many scientists believe thorium would make a good source of nuclear fuel because it makes much less waste and is four times as common as uranium, and does not undergo the wasteful process of Uranium mining|enrichment. It makes 3,200,000 times as much energy as coal and 200 times as much energy as uranium, because natural uranium is mostly non-fissile isotopes. Scientists believe that there is enough of it to power the world for thousands of years. Thorium has been used for various purposes since the 19th century. It is an alloying agent in magnesium and is also used as an industrial Catalysis|catalyst.

Thorium is safer than uranium. This is because thorium cannot undergo fission on its own. Usually, plutonium is need to start and maintain a reaction. This is why thorium is considered better for Nuclear reactor|nuclear reactors. Also, nuclear waste from thorium reactors contains far smaller amounts of dangerous transuranic elements than waste from uranium reactors.
