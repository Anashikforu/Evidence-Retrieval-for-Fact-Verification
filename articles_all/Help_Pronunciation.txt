'''Pronunciation''' of English words in Wikipedia is most often given in the '''International Phonetic Alphabet,''' or IPA. The goal is that interpretation should not depend on the reader's dialect, and therefore a broad transcription is generally used.

'''Since''' this key covers standard British, and Australian pronunciations, not all of the distinctions shown here will be important to your language. If, for example, you pronounce ''cot'' and ''caught'' the same, you can ignore the difference between the symbols  in the pronunciation guides where you would not pronounce it. 

This key does not encode the difference between the vowels of ''bad'' and ''lad'' in Australian English, nor between ''fir, fur,'' and ''fern'' in Scottish English. 

For better use of the IPA to show the differences between English dialects, to transcribe languages other than English, or if the IPA symbols are not displayed on your browser, see the links at the bottom of this page.
