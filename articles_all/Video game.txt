'''Video games''' are Electronics|electronic games played on a video screen (normally a television, a built-in screen when played on a handheld machine, or a computer).

Some of the first were the Atari 2600, the Sega Master System and Nintendo Entertainment System in the 1980s. Newer video game consoles are the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. The best selling video game console of all time is the PlayStation 2, made by Sony.

People can also use computers to play games, which are sometimes called PC games. The older consoles do not have new games developed for them often, although console games are emulated for PCs (see emulator). This means that new computers can play many old console games along with games made just for new computers. Older games are often more popular emulated than when they were first on sale, because of the ease of download.

People can play portable video games anywhere. Mobile devices (running operating systems such as iOS or Android (operating system)|Android) also can download games, making them portable game machines.

 History 
The first video game ever is often said to be ''Tennis for Two'', a rudimentary tennis game to be played with two people developed in 1958. Another early example is ''Spacewar!'', developed in 1962.

In the 1950s, when the first computers began to be made, three people had some ideas to create the basis of actual video games. In 1951, Ralph Baer, an American engineer of Loral Electronics, tried to create "the best television", proposing to add a gaming module, but his employer did not like his idea. Even if his idea was never realized, he is the first man to have thought of the idea of video games, later creating the first video game console, the Odyssey. Later, in 1952, A.S Douglas, of the Cambridge University in the United Kingdom|UK, made a video game on a computer in order to illustrate one of his speeches. The game, called ''OXO'', was a tic-tac-toe game, with two players (the person itself and the opponent, the computer) .In 1953, Willy Higinbotham made a game called ''Tennis For Two'', similar to the later ''Pong'', to entertain visitors to Brookhaven National Laboratory. Another early video game is a version of checkers, but this is largely overlooked. 

One of the most famous and one of the earliest video games ever is called ''Space Invaders''. ''Space Invaders'' was made in 1978 as a coin operated arcade game but a version has been made for almost every game console and home computer ever available.

 2D game 
2D game is a game made by using two-dimentional computer graphic. The first platformers were Space Panic (1980) and Donkey Kong (1981). The first scrolling platformers were Jump Bug (1981), Jungle King (1982) and Jungle Hunt (1982). Namco took the scrolling platformer a step further with the 1984 release Pac-Land.
