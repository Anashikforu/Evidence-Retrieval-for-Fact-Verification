A '''nanosecond''' ('''ns''') is one billionth of a second. It is equal to 10−9 seconds.

One nanosecond is equal to 1000 picoseconds. 1000 nanoseconds is equal to one microsecond. Ten nanoseconds are sometimes called a shake.

Some things that take between one nanosecond and ten nanoseconds are listed below
 Speed of light|Light travels about 29.9&nbsp;centimeters in 1 nanosecond. That is 3.33564095 nanoseconds to move 1 meter.
 It takes a fusion reaction between 20 and 40 nanoseconds to finish in a hydrogen bomb.
 It takes a nuclear reaction 10 nanoseconds to finish one generation with fast neutrons.
 The Half-life (element)|half-life of a Kaon|K meson is 12 nanoseconds.
