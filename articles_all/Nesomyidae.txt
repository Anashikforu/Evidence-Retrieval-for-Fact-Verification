They can give birth to the most four babies after being in the mother's womb for about six weeks.

Still, all members of the Nesomyidae are placed in the family Muridae along with all other members of the Muroidea.

The Nesomyids are classified in 5 subfamily|subfamilies, 22 genus|genera and 55 species.
