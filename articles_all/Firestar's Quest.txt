 Plot 

The story begins with Firestar out in the forest. He gets caught by his own apprentice, Bramblepaw. The next day he becomes a warrior, Brambleclaw. Meanwhile, Firestar's dreams become disturbed by wailing cats, and he eventually goes to the Moonstone, looking for answers. He finds out that the cats are SkyClan cats, the lost Clan from many moons ago. There, he has a discussion with his closest friends, who are his deputy, Graystripe, his medicine cat, Cinderpelt, and his mate, Sandstorm. They decide that Firestar must go. He picks up Sandstorm on his way out of the camp, and heads off along the river.

He now goes along through a storm, and loses Sandstorm. Because of that, he stays a few days in the nearby village to look for her. One he finds her, the pair continue, and find the end of the stream. There, they seek out the last descendant of SkyClan, and talk to him. They are then given their mission: Rebuild SkyClan before it is gone forever. They find many cats, join them up if they choose, and teach them about the ways of the Clans. 

They pick up more and more cats, and eventually, the newly rebuilt SkyClan along with Firestar and his mate fight a gigantic swarm of rats. There, their mission is complete. The first SkyClan's enemies are gone, SkyClan is rebuilt, and the modern SkyClan is now the fifth Clan. There are six Clans once again. ThunderClan, RiverClan, ShadowClan, WindClan, SkyClan, and StarClan are once again all the Clans in history.

The end shows Sandstorm and Firestar with their two kits, Leafkit, named for Leafstar, leader of SkyClan, and Squirrelkit, named for her bushy tail.
