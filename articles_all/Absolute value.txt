In mathematics, the '''absolute value''' of a real number x, written as  or \text{abs}(x), is the value of x when the Sign (mathematics)|sign is dropped (or x without its sign). =0 

For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of âˆ’3 is also 3 (\left\vert x \right\vert = \left\vert -x \right\vert). The absolute value of a real number may be thought of as its distance from zero. It can be Definition|defined as follows:
: 
\begin{cases}
\ \ \ x &\mbox{if}\ \ x \geq 0\\
-x &\mbox{if}\ \ x < 0\\
\end{cases}


Because a distance is always positive, the absolute value of a number is always positive.

Similarly, the absolute value of a complex number may be thought of as its distance from the origin.

It is Definition|defined by the equation 
:
\left\vert a+bi \right\vert = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}

For any real number 
x , the '''absolute value''' of 
x  is denoted by  (a vertical bar on each side of the quantity), and is Definition|defined asMendelson, 
: 
\begin{cases}
\ \ \ x &\mbox{if}\ \ x \geq 0\\
-x &\mbox{if}\ \ x < 0\\
\end{cases}




The absolute value of 
x  is always either positive number|positive or zero, but never negative number|negative. From an analytic geometry point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number's distance from zero along the Number line|real number line. The absolute value of the Subtraction|difference of two Real number|real numbers is the distance between them.

In calculus, the absolute value Function (mathematics)|function is Differential equation|differentiable except at Zero|0. It is Continuous function|continuous everywhere.

In linear algebra, the Norm (mathematics)|norm of a vector is defined similarly as the distance from the tip of the vector to the origin. This is similar to the way the absolute value of a complex number is defined.

The square root notation without Sign (mathematics)|sign represents the ''Positive number|positive'' square root. So, it follows that:

:\left\vert a \right\vert = \sqrt{a^2}

which is another definition of absolute value., p.&nbsp;A5

The absolute value has the following four main properties:

:

Other important properties of the absolute value include:

:

Two other useful properties related to inequalities are:
:\left\vert a \right\vert \le b \Leftrightarrow -b \le a \le b 
:\left\vert a \right\vert \ge b \Leftrightarrow a \le -b \mbox{ or } b \le a 



These relations may be used to solve inequalities involving absolute values. For example:

\left\vert x-3 \right\vert \le 9 \Longleftrightarrow -9 \le x-3 \le 9 \Longleftrightarrow -6 \le x \le 12
