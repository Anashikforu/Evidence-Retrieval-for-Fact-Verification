A '''nucleobase''' is a part of RNA and DNA which may be involved in pairing (see base pair). Nucleobases are important for genetics.

They include cytosine, guanine, adenine, thymine in (DNA), uracil in (RNA) and stimulant|xanthine and hypoxanthine (mutated forms of guanine and adenine). These are abbreviated as C, G, A, T, U, X and HX wikt:respectively|respectively. They are usually simply called '''bases''' in genetics. Because A, G, C and T appear in the DNA, these molecules are called '''DNA-bases'''; A, G, C and U are called '''RNA-bases'''.

Uracil replaces thymine in RNA.
