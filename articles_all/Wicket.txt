In cricket, a '''wicket''' is:

 An object made up of three sticks (called stumps) stuck into the ground|earth, with two small sticks (called bails) balanced on them. They are like a target for the fielding team, and can be hit with the ball to try to get batsmen Out (cricket)|out.
 A batter getting out, meaning they can't bat anymore. A team that has "lost 5 wickets" has had 5 of its batters get out. 
 The cricket pitch itself. 

 Object 
There is one wicket in each of the two batsmen's grounds. The fielding team can hit a wicket with the ball to run out a batsman, but only if there is no batsman in the ground of the wicket.

The wicket is said to have been "put down" when any of its 5 sticks fall to the ground because it was hit by the ball or a player holding the ball. The sticks can be put back in place and then hit back off to put the wicket down more than once.

= Sides of the field =
The field can be defined as having two halves: the "off side" and the "leg side"/"on side", with these being separated by an imaginary line connecting the middle stump of both wickets. The off side of the field is the right side of a field for a right-handed batsman who is looking at the Bowler (cricket)|bowler, and the leg side is the left side. (This is reversed for a left-handed batsman.)
 Batsman getting out 
A batsman is said to have "lost his wicket" when he gets out.
