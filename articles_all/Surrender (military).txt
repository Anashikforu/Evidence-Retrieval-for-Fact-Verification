'''Surrender''' is when soldiers, nations or other combatants stop fighting and eventually become prisoners of war or POW, either as individuals or when ordered to by their officers. A white flag is a common symbol of surrender. Surrender usually occurs when one side of a battle happens to be overpowered by the other and are no longer in the condition to fight any more.
