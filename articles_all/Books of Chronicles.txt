The '''First''' and '''Second Chronicles''' are history books in the Old Testament. They tell the history of Israel differently from the Books of Kings. Using Bible|Biblical books (like Books of Samuel|Samuel and Books of Kings|Kings) and other wikt:source|sources, the "Chronicler" wikt:encourage|encourages the Jews who returned from exile in Babylon. It goes back over Israel's history to explain why they have had all their troubles and how they can live right to become better in the future. One major difference to the similar, earlier narrative is that unlike in Books of Samuel|2 Samuel, David is presented as being good in Chronicles.

Originally, the First and Second Chronicles were one book. They were later split apart into two different books.

 Title 

The Hebrew title (''dibre hayyamim'') means "what happened in the days (or years)". The Septuagint wikt:translate|translators (who translated the Old Testament into Ancient Greek language|Greek) called the book "the things left out". This showed that they thought of it as an addition to Books of Samuel|Samuel and Kings. Jerome (A.D. 347â€“420), who translated the Latin Vulgate, said that a better title would be "chronicle of the whole holy|sacred history". Luther used this idea in his German version, and others have followed him. Chronicles was first divided into two books by the Septuagint translators.

 Author 

Old Jewish tradition says that Ezra wrote Chronicles. However, scholars do not accept this as fact. It is thought that Chronicles was written roughly in the year 400 BC.
