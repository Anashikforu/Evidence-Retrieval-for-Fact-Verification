The system of '''Hebrew numerals''' is a quasi-decimal alphabetic numeral system using the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.

In this system, 0 (number)|zero does not have a place, and the number values for each letter are added together.  Each unit (1, 2, ..., 9) is assigned a separate letter, each tens (10, 20, ..., 90) a separate letter, and each hundreds (100, 200, ..., 900) a separate letter.

Main table
Hebrew has wikt:masculine|masculine and wikt:feminine|feminine ways of saying the words.  For just counting, feminine is used.  Otherwise, the gender is used (ex. two boys, two girls).


The number is first, then the noun (ex. shlosha yeladim), except for number one where it is reversed (ex. yelad echad).
The number two is special. Shnayim (m.) and shtayim (f.) become shney (m.), and shtey (f.) when describing the number of some noun.
Mixed groups are always addressed as male, which is the case with all Hebrew.
Objects are either male or female (ex. a book (''sefer'') is male).
