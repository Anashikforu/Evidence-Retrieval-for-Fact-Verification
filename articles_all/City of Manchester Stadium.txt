Outside the football season, the stadium hosts concerts. It is one of the UK's largest music venues. It has a maximum capacity of 60,000 for performances. The first concert at the stadium was a performance by the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2004. They were supported by James Brown.

Other artists who have played the stadium are U2, Rod Stewart, Foo Fighters supported by Manic Street Preachers and The Futureheads, Bon Jovi & George Michael.

In June 2018, Taylor Swift played the first of her UK â€˜Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation Stadium Tour' over two nights.

Summer activities such as concerts and boxing matches often tear up the pitch. In 2008, end-of-season fixes, along with an early start to the football season, meant the pitch was not ready in time for the first wikt:schedule|scheduled home game. Because of this, Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City played their UEFA Cup first round qualifying match at Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley's Oakwell Stadium.
