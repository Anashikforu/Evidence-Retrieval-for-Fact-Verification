A '''braided river''' is a network of small channels separated by islands that are often not fixed. In other words, the river channels wander across a flat area.

Braided rivers are found in places where the river carries a lot of sediment, and when it slows down and spreads out. The river delta of the Amazon River is a good example on a huge scale, and the Waimakariri River is a good example on a smaller scale.

 Large systems 
Large braided river systems are found around the world:
 Alaska
 Canada
 New Zealand's South Island
 the Himalayas

All these regions contain young mountains that have quick erosion.

Europe has two notably braided rivers:  the Narew, in Poland and Belarus, and the  Tagliamento in northeastern Italy.
