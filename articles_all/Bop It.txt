''Zing It''
''Zing It'' is a yo-yo version of ''Bop It''. It tells commands that the player must follow along with. Like the original ''Bop It'', there are three commands that may be said: "Bop it!" (requiring the player to press the purple button), "Zing it!" (requiring the player to drop the yo-yo downward and send it back up again), and "Loop it!" (requiring the player to do the "'round the world" yo-yo trick). ''Zing It'' has 3 modes: "Vox Bop" (as with Bop It), "Beat Bop" (again, as with Bop It), and "Vox Bop Challenge" (where the game will tell a series of commands which must be done in correctly). As with ''Bop It'' and ''Bop It Extreme'', ''Zing It'' announces the score musically by sound effects. Different tones represent different point values. There is a maximum score of 250.

Video games
