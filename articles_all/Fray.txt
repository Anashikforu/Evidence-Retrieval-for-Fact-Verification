 Connections to ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' 
Fray's scythe was used in the last three episodes of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''. Buffy Summers, also a vampire Slayer, found the scythe stuck in rock in Sunnydale. The scythe was later used to create fully developed Slayers of the many Potential Slayers. It has never been stated as to how the scythe travelled from Sunnydale, California to New York City through the century|centuries, or who had it during that time (or how they got it).

In ''Fray'' it is also explained that sometime in the twenty-first century, "a Slayer, possibly with some mystical allies, faced an apocalypse|apocalyptic army of demons. And when it was done, they were gone. All demons, all magicks, banished from this earthly dimension,". The Slayer, whose fate is unknown, was the last to be called.

Discussing her connection to the Slayer line, Urkonn tells Melaka, "In your dreams, you're someone else. A slave. A princess. A girl in school in a sunlit city." The scar Fray has and her personality are similar to Buffy in the alternate universe created in season 3 episode "The Wish".
