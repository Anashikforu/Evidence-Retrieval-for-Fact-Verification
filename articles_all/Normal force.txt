'''Normal force''' is the force that the ground (or any surface) pushes back up with; If there was no normal force, you would slowly seep into the ground.

The normal force on a object is always Right angle|perpendicular (at a right angle) to the surface the object is on.

On a flat surface, the normal force of an object is mg (the object's weight, that is its mass multiplied by the force of gravity).

On an inclined plane, the normal force is reduced by the angle, and the normal force is mgcos\theta.

Note that on a flat surface, \theta (angle)would be 0, and so cos\theta would be 1. Thus, the two equations are equal.
