'''Avet Terterian''' (1929 - 1994) was a leading Armenian composer, awarded by Konrad Adenauer prize.
He composed eight (completed) symphonies, an opera and several chamber music|chamber works.

Several of his symphony|symphonies are recorded (the date 1973 in the Musicweb review of the Melodiya recording of symphony 3 is probably a typographical error, since the publisher's listing also gives 1975 for the first performance of that work).

Yekaterinburg's annual music festival is named after him.
