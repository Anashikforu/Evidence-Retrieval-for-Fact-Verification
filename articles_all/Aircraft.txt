An '''aircraft''' is a flight|flying machine. 

The word ''aircraft'' originally meant airships and balloons. It comes from the words ''air'' and ''craft'',  a term from boating as were many early aviation words.

There are many different kinds of aircraft.

Some aircraft keep in the sky by moving air over their wing|wings. Examples are aeroplane|aeroplanes, helicopter|helicopters, and glider|gliders. Some aircraft keep in the sky by buoyancy|floating.  Examples are balloon (aircraft)|balloons and airship|airships.

Most aircraft use engine power. Examples are aeroplanes, helicopter, and airship|airships. Gliders and balloons use no power.  A few aircraft use human powered aircraft|muscle power.

Big aeroplanes for transporting people are called ''airliners''. Airliners are the quickest way to travel.  Airliners can fly over mountains and bad weather.  Airliners have complex technology to make them fly quickly, safely and for less money. 

A few fighter aircraft can fly at 3,200&nbsp;km/h (2,000&nbsp;mph). 

The person who drives an aircraft is called the pilot.
