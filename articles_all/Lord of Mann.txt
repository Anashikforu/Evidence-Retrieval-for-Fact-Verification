=Succession dispute (1594-1607)=
In 1598, a succession dispute between the daughters of Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby and Stanley's brother, William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|William Stanley was heard. It was decided by the Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council that the right to the Isle of Man belonged solely to Queen Elizabeth I, and the letters-patent of 1405 which have conferred the Isle of Man to the Stanley family were declared null and void. This was because Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland|Percy had not been subject to legal attainder, despite his treason, and the 1405 and 1406 letters-patent had therefore not taken effect.{{citation

The Queen, in consideration of the "many eminent services performed to herself and to her royal predecessors by the honourable and noble House of Stanley," withdrew her right and referred the contending claimants to the decision of the Privy Council as to the best claim of inheritance.

The Law Lords on the Privy Council decided ''"the grant being by letters patent under the Great Seal of England, such right would descend according to the Common Law of England to the heirs general, and not to the heirs male''", and the island was therefore awarded to Ferdinando's daughters; whereupon William agreed to purchase their several shares and interests.

The original letters-patent having been declared void, the Parliament of England in 1609 under James I of England|James I passed a Private Act of Parliament entitled ''"An Act for assuring and establishing the Isle of Man in the name and blood of William, Earl of Derby"'' (1609) 7 Jac.1 c.''4''. 29 November 2007.

Following the resolution of the succession dispute, it was ruled that the daughters of Ferdinando Stanley were the rightful heirs. As the oldest of them would not reach the age of majority until 1609, two temporary Lords of Mann were appointed by James I of England|James I, using letters patent, so that the daughters could benefit from the Island's revenues.
