 Origins and History 

= Phrygians =
The ancient Greek historians Herodotus and Eudoxus of Rhodes related the Armenians to the Phrygians who entered Asia Minor from Thrace and to the peoples of the ancient kingdom upon whom the Phrygians imposed their rule and language.Armenian (people) | Description, Culture, History, & Facts | Brittanica. "The ancient Greek historians Herodotus and Eudoxus of Rhodes related the Armenians to the Phrygians—who entered Asia Minor from Thrace—and to the peoples of the ancient kingdom upon whom the Phrygians imposed their rule and language." However, the theory that Armenians (or their language) originated in the Balkans has faced further scrutiny and critical approaches in recent years due to the inconsistencies in the timelines and the lack of genetic and archaeological evidence.Hamp, Eric P.

'''Artaxiad dynasty''' 

Round 200 BC a coup by the Armenian noble family of Artaxias toppled the Orontid (Yervanduni) dynasty.Panossian, Razmik (2006). ''The Armenians: From Kings and Priests to Merchants and Commissars''. Columbia University Press. p. 36. ISBN (identifier)|ISBN Special:BookSources/978-0231139267|978-0231139267. Around 200 BC a coup by the Armenian noble family of Artashes(Artaxias) toppled the Yervanduni dynasty. The dynasty was probably a branch of the Orontid (Yervanduni) dynasty of Iranian origin.Garsoian, N. (2005). "TIGRAN II". Encyclopædia Iranica. "Tigran (Tigranes) II was the most distinguished member of the so-called Artašēsid/Artaxiad dynasty, which has now been identified as a branch of the earlier Eruandid Orontid dynasty of Iranian origin attested as ruling in Armenia from at least the 5th century BCE (...)"Garsoian, Nina (2004).

(2005). "TIGRAN II". Encyclopædia Iranica. 

'''Arsacid dynasty''' 

Arsacid dynasty or Arshakuni, ruled the Kingdom of Armenia from 12 to 428.Toumanoff, C. (1986). "Arsacids vii. The Arsacid dynasty of Armenia". Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. II, Fasc. 5. pp. 543–546. The dynasty was a branch of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia. Arsacid kings reigned intermittently throughout the chaotic years following the fall of the Artaxiad dynasty until 62 when Tiridates I secured Arsacid rule in Armenia. However, he did not succeed in establishing his line on the throne, and various Arsacid members of different lineages ruled until the accession of Vologases II, who succeeded in establishing his own line on the Armenian throne. The Arsacid dynasty was overthrown by the Sasanid Empire in 428, and this was the end of the Kingdom of Armenia.Toumanoff, C. (1986). "Arsacids vii. The Arsacid dynasty of Armenia". Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. II, Fasc. 5. pp. 543–546.

= Occupation of Armenia =
'''Byzantine Empire''' 

The Byzantine and Sassanid Empires divided Armenia in 387 and in 428. Western Armenia fell under Byzantine rule, and Eastern Armenia fell under Sassanid control. Even after the establishment of the Bagratid Armenian Kingdom, parts of historic Armenia and Armenian-inhabited areas were still under Byzantine rule. The Armenians had no representation in the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451, due to their struggle against the Sassanids in an armed rebellion. For that reason, there appeared a theological drift between Armenian and Byzantine Christianity. Many Byzantine emperors were of Armenian descent; Heraclius, the founder of the Heraclian dynasty,Kaegi, Walter Emil (2003). Heraclius, Emperor of Byzantium. Cambridge University Press. p. 21, "Heraclius the Younger was born son of Heraclius the Elder and Epiphania ca. 575, and was probably of Armenian descent (...)"Geanakoplos, Deno J. (1984).

A History of the Byzantine State and Society. Stanford University Press. p. 287, "Heraclius ... his family were Armenians from Cappadocia (...)" and Basil I, the founder of the Macedonian dynasty,Gregory, Timothy E. (2010). A History of Byzantium.

"...a number of important military leaders and civil administrators were Armenian, including emperors Leo V, Basil I, Romanos I Lekapenos, and John I Tzimiskes." were of Armenian descent.

'''Sasanian Empire''' 

In 428, Armenian nobles petitioned Bahram V to depose Artaxias IV (r. 422).''Introduction to Christian Caucasian History:II: States and Dynasties of the Formative Period'', Cyril Toumanoff, '''Traditio''', Vol. 17, 1961, Fordham University, 6. Bahram V (r. 420–438) abolished the Kingdom of Armenia and appointed Veh Mihr Shapur as ''marzban'' of the country, which marked the start of a new era known as the Marzpanate period''',''' a period when ''marzbans'', nominated by the Sasanian emperor, governed eastern Armenia, as opposed to the western Byzantine Armenia which was ruled by several princes, and later governors, under Byzantine suzerainty. The Marzpanate period ended with the Arab conquest of Armenia in the 7th century, when the Principality of Armenia was established. An estimated three million Armenians were under the influence of the ''marzpans'' during this period.Yeremian, Suren. «Մարզպանական Հայաստան» (Marzpan Armenia). The Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia. vol. vii. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1981, pp. 313-315.

Armenia was later invaded by the Arabs.

= '''Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia''' =
The Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia, was an independent Armenian state established by Ashot I Bagratuni of the Bagratuni dynasty in the early 880sGrigoryan, M. (2012). "Բագրատունյաց թագավորության սկզբնավորման թվագրության շուրջ On Dating Bagratid Armenia". Lraber Hasarakakan Gitutyunneri (in Armenian) ('''2–3''') following nearly two centuries of foreign domination of Greater Armenia under Arab Umayyad and Abbasid rule. With each of the two contemporary powers in the region  the Abbasids and Byzantines  too preoccupied to concentrate their forces in subjugating the people of the region, and with the dissipation of several of the Armenian ''nakharar'' noble families, Ashot succeeded in asserting himself as the leading figure of a movement to dislodge the Arabs from Armenia.Bournoutian, George A. (2006). A Concise History of the Armenian People: From Ancient Times to the Present. Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda. p. 89. The first half of the 11th century saw the decline and eventual collapse of the kingdom. The Byzantine emperor Basil II (r. 976–1025) won a string of victories and annexed parts of southwestern Armenia; King Hovhannes-Smbat felt forced to cede his lands and in 1022 promised to "will" his kingdom to the Byzantines following his death. However, after Hovhannes-Smbat's death in 1041, his successor, Gagik II, refused to hand over Ani and continued resistance until 1045, when his kingdom, plagued with internal and external threats, was finally taken by Byzantine forces.Bournoutian. Concise History, p. 87.
