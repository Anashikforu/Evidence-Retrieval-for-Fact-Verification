'''Applied mechanics''', also known as '''theoretical and applied mechanics''', is a branch of the Physics|physical sciences and the practical application of mechanics.  Applied mechanics examines the ''response of bodies (solids and fluids) to external Force (physics)|forces''.  Some examples of ''mechanical systems'' include the Flux|flow of a liquid under pressure, the Material fracture|fracture of a solid from an applied Force (physics)|force, or the vibration of an ear in response to sound.  A practitioner of the discipline is known as a mechanician.  

Applied mechanics, as its name suggests, bridges the gap between physical theory and its application to technology.
