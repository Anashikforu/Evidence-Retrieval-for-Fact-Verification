"'''Amazing Grace'''" is a poem written in 1772 by English people|Englishman John Newton. The poem named, "Faith's Review and Expectation", was where the song came from. It was set to music. A seventh stanza, by an unknown author, has been added to most versions since 1829, beginning with the words, "When we've been there ten thousand years". In some versions, stanzas five and six to the song are cut and go directly to the seventh.

 John Newton and the lyrics to Amazing Grace 

;Amazing Grace

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
   That sav’d a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
   Was blind, but now I see.

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
   And grace my fears reliev’d;
How precious did that grace appear,
   The hour I first believ’d!

Thro’ many dangers, toils and snares,
   I have already come;
’Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
   And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promis’d good to me,
   His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be,
   As long as life endures.

Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
   And mortal life shall cease;
I shall possess, within the veil,
   A life of joy and peace.

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
   The sun forbear to shine;
But God, who call’d me here below,
   Will be forever mine.

           (Anonymous 1829 addition:)
When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
   Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
   Than when we’d first begun.
