'''Grylloblattidae''' is a family (biology)|family of extremophile and wingless insects that live in the cold on top of mountains. 

They are commonly called '''grylloblattids''', but are also sometimes called '''ice crawlers''' or '''icebugs'''. 

Most are nocturnal and appear to feed on detritus (rubbish). They have long Antenna (biology)|antennae (23–45 segments) and long cercus|cerci (appendages on the rear; 5–8 segments), but no wings. 

Their closest living relatives are the recently-discovered Mantophasmatidae.

The family is placed in its own suborder, '''Grylloblattodea''', and sometimes in its own Order (biology)|order, '''Grylloblattaria'''. It contains 5 genera and 25 species.
