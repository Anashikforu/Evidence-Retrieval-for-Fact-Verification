They were built for British Rail between 1989 and 1992 by BREL at their Derby Carriage and Wagon Works|Derby Works. They were built to replace old DMUs and locomotive-hauled passenger trains. British Rail Class 159|Class 159 trains are almost the same as Class 158s. They work many non-electrified services such as Exeter St David's To London Waterloo.

BREL also built 20 carriages to 1m gauge for export to Thailand in 1990/1.
