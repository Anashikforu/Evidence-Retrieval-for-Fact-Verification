The 35.7-kilometre '''Circle MRT Line''' ('''CCL''') is Singapore's fourth Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit line, and the first medium capacity line. As the name implies, the line is an orbital line linking all radial lines leading to the city, and also covering many parts of the Central Area. It will also connect to Marina South via a spur line branching off from Promenade and ending at Marina Bay. Circle Line is not a full circle, and the Stage 6 will only merge the section from Marina Bay to HarbourFront. The line is colored yellow on the MRT Rail map.

The first part opened to the public from Bartley MRT Station|Bartley to Marymount MRT Station|Marymount on May 28, 2009. When finished, the line will connect all MRT lines, and will allow passengers to bypass the downtown area, so that the City Hall and Raffles Place interchange stations will be less crowded. The second part opened to the public from Bartley MRT Station|Bartley to Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station|Dhoby Ghaut on April 17, 2010 while the remaining parts will be opened in October 8, 2011. Circle Line Extension (CCLe) had been in operation since 14 January 2012.
