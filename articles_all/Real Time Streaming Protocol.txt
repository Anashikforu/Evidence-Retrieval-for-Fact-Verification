The '''Real Time Streaming Protocol''' ('''RTSP'''), developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF and created in 1998 as RFC 2326, is a communications protocol|protocol for use in streaming media systems, which allows a client to remotely control a streaming media server, issuing VCR-like commands such as "play" and "pause", and allowing time-based access to files on a server.

The sending of streaming data itself is '''not''' part of the RTSP protocol. Most RTSP servers use the standards-based Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP as the transport protocol for the actual audio/video data. The RTSP server from RealNetworks also features RealNetworks' proprietary RDT stream transport|RDT as the transport protocol.
