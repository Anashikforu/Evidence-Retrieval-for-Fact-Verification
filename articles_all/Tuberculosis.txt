'''Tuberculosis (TB)''' is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. In the past, people called it '''consumption'''.

TB is caused by several types of Mycobacterium|mycobacteria, usually ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis''. The disease usually attacks the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body.

 How it spreads 
The bacteria can travel through the air and spread from one person to the next. This happens when infected people cough, sneeze, or spit.

Of every 100 people with TB, between five and ten people show symptoms.  In these people, the disease is called ''active''.  Tuberculosis kills more than half of the people who are infected if they do not get treatment.

Detection and treatment


Diagnosis of active TB relies on radiology. Doctors often look at an X-ray of the chest. In addition, they check body fluids. These fluids have microbes in them, which are grown in cell cultures. The cell cultures are then analysed to see if the person is infected with TB.

If the patient has TB, but does not show symptoms, the disease is 'latent'. Doctors use a skin test, called the Mantoux test, to detect latent TB. They often do blood tests too.

There is a vaccine against some forms of tuberculosis. It is called bacillus Calmette-Guérin|bacillus Calmette&ndash;Guérin vaccine.

TB used to be easily treated and cured with antibiotics. However, the bacterium is now highly resistant to most antibiotics. This resistance makes treatment difficult. Many different kinds of antibiotics need to be given over a long period of time. There is a form of tuberculosis that is resistant to ''all'' drugs.

 Symptoms 
Tuberculosis can have many symptoms.  The most common include:
 A cough that does not go away, especially if the person is coughing up blood (this is called hemoptysis)
 Chest pain
 Not having any appetite
 Weakness
 Weight loss
 Chills
 Very pale skin
 Listless eyes 
 Fever
 Sweating a lot at night
 Dyspnea|Difficulty breathing
 Fatigue|Feeling very tired
 People are also more likely to get tuberculosis if they live close to other people who have TB.  For example, TB can spread easily in homeless shelters, prisons, and Immigration|immigrant communities.

How common is TB?

Experts believe that one third of the world population is infected with ''M. tuberculosis''. The number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2006, and new cases have decreased since 2002.

Tuberculosis does not happen at the same rate around the world. About eighty percent of the population in many Asian and African countries test positive for TB, but only five to ten percent of people in the United States do.

People usually get tuberculosis because of a weakened immune system. Many people with HIV and AIDS can also get tuberculosis.
