'''Cargo cult''' is a name given to several religions. There are many cargo cults in Melanesia and New Guinea. These religions are started when tribe|tribal societies come into contact with Western civilisation. When the first contact happened, the tribespeople saw Western manufactured goods, like radios. These things are called ''cargo''. The tribespeople did not know how the manufactured goods worked nor how they were made.  

They imitate the behaviour they saw the Westerners do, in the hope that some spirits will send them more cargo.  In other cases, such as on the island of Tanna (island)|Tanna in Vanuatu, cult members worship Americans who brought the cargo.

During the age of colonialism, the colonial powers came in contact with many technologically less advanced societies. The first cargo cults were documented in New Guinea, and other countries of Micronesia, Melanesia and the West Pacific Ocean. 

The people who are part of the cargo cults think that the cargo was created by their deity|deities and ancestors. They think that the cargo was made for the members of the cargo cult, but the foreigners have it. For this reason, the efforts and rituals of cargo cults are done so that the foreigners should get less of these goods and the cult members more of them.
