The '''cubic metre''' (symbol '''m³''') is the SI unit of volume. It is a cube with a length, height, and width of one metre, with 1,000 litres of space.

In the many places it is spelled "'''cubic meter'''". Other names are '''stère''' and '''kilolitre''' or '''kiloliter'''.

 Conversions 

1 cubic metre equals:
 1,000 litres
 Approximately 35.3 cubic foot|cubic feet
 Approximately 1.31 cubic yards
 Approximately 6.29 barrel (unit)|oil barrels

A cubic metre of pure water at the temperature of maximum density (3.98 Celsius|°C) and standard atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa) has a mass of 1000 kilogram|kg, or one tonne. At 0&nbsp;°C, the freezing point of water, it is slightly less, 999.972 kg.

It is sometimes abbreviated '''''', when superscript Glyph|characters or markup are not available/accessible (i.e. in some typewritten documents and postings in Usenet newsgroups).

Abbreviated '''CBM''' in the freight business and '''MTQ''' (or numeric code 49) in international trade.
