A '''clipper''' was a very fast sailing ship of the 19th century.  The word "clipper" comes from a word meaning: "fast".  Clippers had several Mast (sailing)|masts and a square rig. They were quite narrow for their length. Clipper ships were mostly made in British and American shipyards, but France, the Netherlands and other countries also made some. Clippers sailed all over the world, especially on the trade routes between the United Kingdom and its colony|colonies in the east, in trans-Atlantic trade, and the New York-to-San Francisco route round Cape Horn during the California Gold Rush.  Netherlands|Dutch clippers were built beginning in 1850s for bringing tea to Europe and taking passengers to and from Java.
