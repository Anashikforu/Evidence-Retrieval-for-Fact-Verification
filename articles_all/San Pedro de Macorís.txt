The Dominican Republic|Dominican city of '''San Pedro de Macorís''' is the head municipality of the San Pedro de Macorís Province|San Pedro de Macorís province, on the southeast of the country.

It has the nickname of ''Macorís del mar'' ("Macorís by the sea") to differentiate it from San Francisco de Macorís, in the Duarte Province.

History
There were two very small towns on the left side of the mouth of the river Macorís (or Higuamo): ''Mosquito'' (because there were too many mosquitos) and ''Sol'' (English: "Sun", because there were not trees). Even today, San Pedro de Macorís is called sometimes ''Mosquitisol'' after those two old and small towns.

Since 1852, there was a military post in this place: the Military Post of Macorís, part of the Hato Mayor del Rey municipality in the El Seibo Province.

In 1856, the priest Pedro Carrasco built a Catholicism|Catholic church with the name ''San Pedro Apóstol''; the church was between the two towns of Mosquito and Sol. Both towns grew in direction of the church, forming one town called '''San Pedro de Macorís'''.

When the country was again a Spain|Spanish colony, San Pedro de Macorís was made a "Comandancia de Armas" (an Spanish military category). When the country was free again, in 1865, every town with the category of "Comandancia de Armas" became a municipality. But San Pedro de Macorís was still a very small town of the El Seibo Province.

After 1868, with the sugarcane plantations and the sugar factories, San Pedro de Macorís began to grow and it became one of the most important city in the Dominican Republic. Many people from Cuba and Puerto Rico came to live here during the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th century. Later came people from Spain and the Middle East (Lebanon, Syria) to work in businesses.

To work in the sugarcane fields and factories, people from Haiti and the Great Britain|British Caribbean|West Indies came to San Pedro de Macorís and other regions of the country.
