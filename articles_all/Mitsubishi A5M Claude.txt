The '''A5M Claude''' was a Japanese fighter aircraft made by Mitsubishi. It first flew in 1935 and was introduced in 1937. It was the first monoplane (fixed-wing aircraft with one set of wings) that could work from an aircraft carrier. After the Pearl Harbor attacks, it was not good enough to fight against American fighters like the Curtiss P-40 and the F4F Wildcat, so it was replaced by the A6M Zero.

Near the end of WW2, many A5Mâ€™s were pulled out of retirement to be used as suicidal Kamikaze|kamikaze aircraft.
