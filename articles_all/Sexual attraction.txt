'''Sexual attraction''' is an attraction to other members of the same species for sexual or erotic activity. In many species this does not always mean a sexual intercourse|sexual act; indeed, some sexual behavior among primates is mostly a social activity.

 In humans 
What is sexually attractive to humans may change by culture or place. The sexual attraction of one person to another depends on both people. 

Much of human sexual attraction|attractiveness is physical (see beauty). This involves the impact one's appearance has on the senses, especially in the beginning of a relationship:

 Visual perception (how the other looks); 
 Olfaction (how the other smells, naturally or artificially; the wrong smell may be repellent);
 Audition (how the other's voice and/or movements sound).
