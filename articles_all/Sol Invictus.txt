'''Sol Invictus''' ("the Unconquered Sun") or, more fully, '''Deus Sol Invictus''' ("the Unconquered Sun god") was a religious title applied to at least three distinct Deity|deities during the later Roman Empire: Elagabalus Sol Invictus|El Gabal, Mithras, and Sol.

The earlier cult of Helios|Sol Indiges ("the native sun" or "the invoked sun")the etymology and meaning of the word "indiges" is disputed was agrarian. The title ''Deus Sol Invictus'' was formed similar to the imperial titulature ''pius felix invictus'' ("dutiful, fortunate, unconquered").

The Romans held a festival on December 25 called ''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'', "the birthday of the unconquered sun." The use of the title '''Sol Invictus''' allowed several solar deities to be worshipped together, including Elagabalus Sol Invictus|Elah-Gabal, a Syrian sun god; Sol, the patron god of Emperor Aurelian (AD 270-274); and Mithras, a soldiers' god of Persian religions|Persian origin."
