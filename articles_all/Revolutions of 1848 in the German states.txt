The '''Revolutions in the German states''' developed in most of the 38 states of Germany that were loosely bound together in the German Confederation after the Congress of Vienna in 1815. To these states belonged Austria as well though Hungary that was part of the Austria-Hungary|Austrian-Hungarian Empire was not part of the German Confederation.

These revolutions had as example the French Revolution of 1848 in February 1848, when King Phillipe of France abdication|abdicated the throne.

The biggest successes of the German revolutions happened in March in Berlin and Vienna. The result was the election of a German National Assembly in Frankfurt am Main.



But it was in Berlin too where the Prussian king Frederick William refused to become emperor of a Unification of Germany|united German state.
Austria and Prussia withdrew their delegates from the Assembly, and the Assembly itself slowly disintegrated afterwards.
