Image:Archivist Survey.jpg|right|thumb|An Archivist surveying an unprocessed collection of materials. Surveying is commonly done to determine priorities for preservation and/or conservation of materials before an archivist begins arrangement and description.

An '''archivist''' is a professional who  collects, organizes, preservation|preserves, maintains control over, and provides access to information determined to have long-term value.  The information maintained by an archivist can be any form of media (photographs, video or sound recordings, letters, documents, electronic records, etc.).

As Richard Pearce-Moses wrote, 
''"Archivists keep records that have enduring value as reliable memories of the past, and they help people find and understand the information they need in those records."'' Pearce-Moses, Richard. "Identity and Diversity: What Is an Archivist?" ''Archival Outlook'', March/April 2006.

Determining what records have enduring value is not always easy.  Archivists must also select records valuable enough to justify the costs of storage and preservation, plus the labor-intensive expenses of arrangement, description,  and reference service.  The theory and scholarly work underpinning archives practices is called archival science.
