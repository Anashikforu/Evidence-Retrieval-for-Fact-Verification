'''Fredericksburg''' is a city in Virginia in the United States. It was important in the American Civil War, because of its location on the Rappahannock River, near the capital of the North (Washington, DC) and the South (Richmond, Virginia). In late 1862 the Battle of Fredericksburg was fought there.
