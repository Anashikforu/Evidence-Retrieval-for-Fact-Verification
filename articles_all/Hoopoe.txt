The '''hoopoe''' (''Upupa epops''), is a colourful bird that is found across Africa|Afro-Eurasia, notable for its distinctive 'crown' of feathers.

It is the only living species in the family '''Upupidae'''. One insular species, the giant hoopoe of Saint Helena, is recently extinct, and the Madagascar subspecies of the hoopoe is sometimes elevated to a full species. The English name is derived from Latin ''upupa'', which imitates the cry of the bird.

 Taxonomy 
The hoopoe is classified in the Coraciiformes clade, a group that also includes kingfishers, bee-eaters, rollers, and woodhoopoes (forming a clade with this one according to Hackett ''et al.'' (2008)
= Subspecies =


Nine subspecies of hoopoe are recognised by the Kristin 2001 (in the ''Handbook of the Birds of the World''). These subspecies vary mostly in size and the depth of colour in the plumage. Two more subspecies have been proposed, ''U. e. minor'' in South Africa and ''U. e. orientalis'' in north western India.
