 History 

South Korea and the United States began the Hoguk exercise which they did every year. The Hoguk exercise was a large military practice with both South Korean and US militaries. The 2010 exercise used 70,000 soldiers from all four kinds of the South Korean military. They had 600 land vehicles, 90 helicopters, 50 warships, and 500 aircraft.Won-je, Son. "
 Engagement 

On the morning of 23 November, North Korea said that it complained to the South, "asking whether (the Hoguk exercise) was an attack against the North". It said that it would not allow firing in what the North thought was its part of the sea."
At 14:34 in Korean time, North Korea moved 22-mm Multiple Launch Rocket System shells towards an artillery place in Kaemori.
Several fires began because of the North Korean shelling, so the South Korean military moved civilians away from Yeonpyeong.

 Damage 

Two South Korean soldiers, Hasa (Sergeant) Seo Jeong-wu and Ilbyeong (Private First Class) Moon Gwang-wuk, were killed. Six other people in the military were seriously hurt. Two workers on the island, Kim Chi-baek, who was 61, and Bae Bok-chul, who was 60, were also killed.
