'''Basilosaurus''' is a genus of cetacean that lived from 40 to 34 million years ago in the Late Eocene. The first ''Basilosaurus'' fossils were found in Louisiana, United States|USA, but another species was soon discovered preserved in large numbers in the Fayum deposits of Egypt.

The first fossil of ''B. cetoides'' was discovered in the United States and was initially believed to be some sort of reptile, hence the suffix -"saurus", but it was later found to be a marine mammal. 

Far from being a marine reptile, ''Basilosaurus'' is a stage in the evolution of whales. At 15–20&nbsp;m (49–66&nbsp;ft), ''Basilosaurus'' was one of the largest oceanic animals of its time. Basilosaurus went extinct during the Eocene Extinction.
