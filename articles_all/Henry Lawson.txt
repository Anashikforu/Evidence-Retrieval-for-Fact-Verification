'''Henry Archibald Hertzberg Lawson''' (17 June 1867 – 2 September 1922) was an Australian writer and poet. Along with Banjo Paterson, he is remembered as one of the best Australian writers. He wrote about life in the Australian bush.

Lawson was an Australian nationalism|nationalist and republicanism in Australia|republican, and he wanted Australia to become and independent nation. Lawson wrote many stories and articles for ''The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin''. He used the Australian language in his stories. From the 1890s he suffered from alcoholism and mental illness which meant he did not write as much in his later years. He never had much money, and spent time in Darlinghurst Gaol and psychiatric institutions. After he died in 1922 following a cerebral haemorrhage, Lawson became the first Australian writer to be granted a state funeral.

His mother was Louisa Lawson, a poet, publisher and feminist.
