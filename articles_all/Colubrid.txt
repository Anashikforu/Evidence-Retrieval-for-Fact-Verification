A '''colubrid''' (from Latin ''coluber'', snake) is a snake that is a member of the '''Colubridae''' family (biology)|family. Colubridae is the largest snake family, and includes about two-thirds of all known living snake species. However, colubrids are ''certainly not a Monophyly|natural group'', and many are more closely related to other groups, such as elapids, than to each other. This family has classically been a wastebasket taxon|dumping ground for snakes that do not fit anywhere else. There is on-going mitochondrial DNA research which will sort out the familial relations within this group.Lawson R. ''et al'' 2005. Phylogeny of the Colubroidea (Serpentes): new evidence from mitochondrial and nuclear genes. ''Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution'' '''37''': 581â€“601. 
A colubrid's body is almost completely covered in scales. Most colubrids are not venomous and are normally harmless. A few groups, such as genus ''Boiga'', can produce medically significant bites. In addition, the Boomslang and African twig snake have both caused human fatalities. The venom-injecting fangs associated with venomous colubrids are almost always in the back of the mouth, in contrast to Viperidae|vipers and elapids.
