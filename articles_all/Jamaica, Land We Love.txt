:Eternal Father, bless our land
:Guide us with Thy mighty hand
:Keep us free from evil powers
:Be our light through countless hours
:To our leaders, Great Defender,
:Grant true wisdom from above
:Justice, truth be ours forever
:Jamaica, land we love
:Jamaica, Jamaica, Jamaica, land we love

:Teach us true respect for all
:Stir response to duty's call
:Strengthen us the weak to cherish
:Give us vision lest we perish
:Knowledge send us, Heavenly Father,
:Grant true wisdom from above
:Justice, truth be ours forever
:Jamaica, land we love
:Jamaica, Jamaica, Jamaica, land we love
