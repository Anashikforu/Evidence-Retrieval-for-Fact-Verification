There is a door deep in the sewers of Rogueport (the Thousand-Year Door) which will open if all the crystal stars are collected. It is said that a demonic spirit rests behind the door. The X-Nauts (a group of robot-like people) try to steal all of the crystal stars in order to awaken a evil demon to wipe out the planet so that they can become dictators of the world.
 The last boss (video game)|boss of the game is the Shadow Queen who possesses (takes over) Princess Peach.
