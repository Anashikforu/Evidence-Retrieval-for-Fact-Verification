The '''Antonov An-225 ''Mriya'''''  was a Russian/Ukrainian Aircraft, and the largest airplane by weight in the world. It had 6 engines, which was necessary for itâ€™s sheer size. It was manufactured by a company called Antonov. The Mriya was designed to transport the Russian Shuttle, Space Shuttle Buran. The Buran only flew once, and was successful. However, the funding of Buran was insufficient, and, the project quickly ended. The remaining plane, registration UR-82060,  was used to  carry very large items that were not efficient by train, to be carried by the Antonov. 

The company ownership was changed, due to the Collapse of the Soviet Union. The ownership of Antonov was switched to the country of Ukraine|Ukraine, and all assets were shipped to Kyiv, or Kiev. It was modelled from the Antonov An-124 Ruslan. This plane is big enough to carry a Boeing 747's fuselage. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the last aircraft, UR-82060, was destroyed in the hangar of the airport of the Antonov Serial Production Plant in Ukraine.
