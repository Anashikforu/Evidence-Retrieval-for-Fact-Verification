The '''University of Prishtina''' is the name of two public universities in Kosovo, sharing the same history up to a point of separation, which took place in 1999. The university was founded in the city of Prishtina in 1970 and segregated as a result of ethnic-based polarisation. The two separate institutions are using the same name, in Prishtina (Pri≈°tina) and Mitrovica.
