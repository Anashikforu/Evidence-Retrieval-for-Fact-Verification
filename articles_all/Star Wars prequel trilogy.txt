The '''Star Wars''' prequel trilogy is a series of movies released between May 1999 and May 2005. All three movies were written and directed by George Lucas.

Production
Lucasfilm started production on The Phantom Menace after George Lucas got interested in reviving the Star Wars franchise.

Reception
While all three movies are financially successful, the first two movies had mixed reviews, with the final movie having better reviews. Critics didn't like the dialogue and some of the characters, including Jar Jar Binks. The trilogy has been popular with Millennials who grew up with the movies. Because of this, the subreddit called Prequel Memes gained popularity.
