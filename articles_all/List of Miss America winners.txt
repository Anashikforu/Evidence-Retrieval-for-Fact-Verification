'''Miss America''' is an United States|American beauty contest. It is an wikt:annual|annual competition open to women from the United States between the ages of 17 and 24. Contestants are judged on talent and interviews in addition to their physical attractiveness. It is run by the ''Miss America Organization'', a non-profit organization based in Linwood, New Jersey. The corporation has developed the "Miss America Scholarship Program", which awards educational scholarships to successful competitors.

The contest began in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1921. It was an idea of newspaper reporter, Harry Finley, to increase newspaper sales and to promote Atlantic City. She won the "Inter-City Beauty, Amateur" and "The Most Beautiful Bathing Girl in America" contests. She was given the Golden Mermaid Trophy. Because these were awkward titles, in 1922 Gorman was renamed as "Miss America".
