The number 100 is written as "one hundred", but sometimes people say "a hundred".

The way numbers are written and spoken differs between American English and other forms of English, such as British English and Australian English, as follows.

 American English 

To write a whole number from 100 to 999 in American English:
  First write how many hundreds.
  Then write the word "hundred".
  Then write the name of the two-digit number after the digit in the hundreds place.

In standard, written, American English, the word "and" is ''not'' in the word-name of any whole number even though many speakers insert it.

Examples:

 101: one hundred one
 102: one hundred two
 175: one hundred seventy-five
 200: two hundred
 300: three hundred
 512: five hundred twelve
 987: nine hundred eighty-seven

 British and Commonwealth English 

To write a whole number from 100 to 999 in British and Commonwealth English:
  First write how many hundreds.
  Then write the words "hundred and".
  Then write the name of the two-digit number after the digit in the hundreds place.

In standard, written, British English (and the English spoken in many other places), the word "and" ''is'' in the word-name of many whole numbers.

Examples:

 101: one hundred and one (NOT: one hundred one)
 102: one hundred and two (NOT: one hundred two)
 175: one hundred and seventy-five (NOT: one hundred seventy-five)
 200: two hundred
 300: three hundred
 512: five hundred and twelve (NOT: five hundred twelve)
