'''Shear stress''' is a stress (physics)|stress state where the stress is parallel to the surface of the material, as opposed to Tensile stress|normal stress when the stress is :en:Perpendicular|perpendicular to the surface. 

Shear stress is relevant to themotion (physics)| motion of fluids upon surfaces, which result in the generation of shear stress.
Also constructions in soil can fail due to shear; e.g., the weight of an earth-filled dam may cause the subsoil to collapse, like a small landslide.
