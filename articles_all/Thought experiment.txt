A '''thought experiment''' is an experiment that takes place in people's minds instead of in a laboratory or in the real world. In a real-life experiment, people can see and measure changes, but thought experiments only show special ways of thinking.  Anyone can do a thought experiment.

The usual goal of a thought experiment is to show what might happen: ''if this were true, what would follow from it?''

The history of science has many thought experiments in it. Hans Christian Ørsted was the first to use the German term '''' has purely Germanic languages|Germanic roots.
