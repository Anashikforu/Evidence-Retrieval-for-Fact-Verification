The '''River Exe''' is a river in the county of Devon in England. It usually flows directly south through the city of Exeter. The island had many mill (grinding)|mills making paper and textiles, and also created valuable land by draining the marshlands. The wide estuary of the River Exe is a ria (drowned river valley).

The name of the city of Exeter means "castle on the river Exe".
