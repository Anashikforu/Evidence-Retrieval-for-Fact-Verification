'''Sexual assault''' is the act of violation, a process when two people come in contact of a sexual intercourse|sexual nature, but one of them does not want this contact to happen. This happens when sexual excitement  damages prefrontal cortex of the offender and experience of dissociative-like symptoms that leaves the person to primitive reflexes. Evolutionary biologist Randy Thornhill and evolutionary anthropologist Craig Palmer theorize that the primary motive behind sexual assault is sexual intercourse|sex and signifies the inability of the perpetrator to deal with their own emotions for adaptive response.
A study states "successful inhibition of sexual expressions (restrain, cancel, suppress) is a natural and adaptive reaction to contextual factors against the excitatory expressions (initiate, execute, promote), and enables the regulation of sexual behavior, thereby preventing undesired consequences for the individual and for society."Rodriguez-Nieto, G., Emmerling, F., Dewitte, M. et al. The Role of Inhibitory Control Mechanisms in the Regulation of Sexual Behavior. Arch Sex Behav 48, 481â€“494 (2019). 
In some cultures being sexually experienced is a required aspect of psychological maturity to achieve balance in desire, and a person lacking it is subjected to Social stigma|stigmatization. Popularity of online dating applications and their role in the hookup culture of certain societies are an example of it.
