The '''inch of mercury''' ('''inHg''' or '''"Hg''') was a non-SI unit of pressure. It was used for measuring barometric pressure, (the thickness of air), in weather forecasts, and aviation (flying), but was replaced by the pascal (unit)|pascal.

It is the amount of pressure that a column of mercury (element)|mercury that is one inch tall has at 0 °C at the standard gravity|standard acceleration of gravity, or how fast things speed up as they are falling because of gravity.

:1 inHg at 0 °C = 3,386.389 pascal (unit)|Pa.
