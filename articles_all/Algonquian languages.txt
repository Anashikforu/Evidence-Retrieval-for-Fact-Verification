''Native American Place Names of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 32 Many Algonquian languages are extremely endangered today, while a number of others have already died out completely.

Speakers of Algonquian languages stretch from the east coast of North America all the way to the Rocky Mountains. The language from which all of the languages of the family come was spoken at least 3,000 years ago.

The Algonquian languages are 'poly-synthetic', which means that you can make entire sentences in one word.
