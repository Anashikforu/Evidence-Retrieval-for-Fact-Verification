The '''Near East''' is a large area of land in the eastern hemisphere. Countries of the eastern Mediterranean are part of the Near East. The name of the Near East comes from its position to the east of Europe and to the west of the Middle East and the Far East.

The Levant, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Iran, and Egypt are all regions that are part of the Near East. In the past, the Balkan Peninsula, Southwest Asia|south-west Asia, and northern Africa were part of the Near East as well.

The Near East is also a name for Middle East which archaeologists, geographers and historians use.

 Background 

The term ''Near East'' came into use in the 1890s, when European powers had to do with two critical situations in the "east". The First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War in 1894â€“1895 in the Far East, and the Armenian Genocide in the Near East.

British archaeologist D.G. Hogarth published ''The Nearer East'' in 1902, which helped to define the term and its extent, including Albania, Montenegro, southern Serbia and Bulgaria, Greece, Egypt, all the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman lands, the entire Arabian peninsula, and western parts of Iran.
