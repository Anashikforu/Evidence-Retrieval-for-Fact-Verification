Moles are found in North America, Europe and Asia. They eat insects, larvae or worms. Moles have velvety, soft fur. They have powerful front paws so they can dig. A mole has an extra thumb.

three subfamilies, 17 genera and 46 species in total in this very common group of mammals. Moles have poor vision.
