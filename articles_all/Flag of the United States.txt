The '''flag of the United States|United States of America''' is a national flag. It has 7 red stripes and 6 white stripes. These 13 stripes represent the original thirteen colonies. The flag also has a blue ''canton'', a rectangle in the top left corner. There are 50 stars which represent the 50 U.S. state|states of America.

When a new state joins the United States, a new flag is made with an extra star. The new flag is first flown on the 4th of July (Independence Day (US)|Independence Day).

The last states to join the United States were Alaska and Hawaii in 1959. Alaska joined on 3 January 1959, so the new flag with 49 stars was used from 4 July 1959. Hawaii joined on 21 August 1959, so the flag with 50 stars that is used today was not flown until 4 July 1960. This 50 star design was created by Robert G. Heft for a school project. 

The colors in the flag are red, white and blue. The colors have no special meaning in the flag, but in the Coat of arms of the United States|coat of arms, white stands for purity and innocence, red for bravery and strength, and blue for watchfulness, perseverance and justice. 

The flag is also often called the '''Stars and Stripes''', the '''Star-Spangled Banner''', or '''Old Glory'''. The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem of the United States is a reference to the flag.

 Evolution of the United State's flag 
Since 1818, a star for each new state has been added to the flag on the Fourth of July immediately following each state's admission. In years in which multiple states have been admitted, the number of stars on the flag has jumped correspondingly. The greatest example so far was in 1890, when five states were admitted within the span of a single year (North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington (U.S. state)|Washington in November 1889 and Idaho on 3 July 1890). This change has typically been the only change made with each revision of the flag since 1777, with the exception of changes in 1795 and 1818, which increased the number of stripes to 15 and then returned it to 13, respectively.

As the exact pattern of stars was not specified prior to 1912, and the exact colors not specified prior to 1934, many of the historical U.S. national flags (shown below) have had varied designs.
