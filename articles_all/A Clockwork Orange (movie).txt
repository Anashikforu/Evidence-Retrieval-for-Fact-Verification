It was written, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. It is based on Anthony Burgess' 1962 short novel ''A Clockwork Orange''. It includes disturbing, violent images. Its social commentary touches on psychiatry, youth gangs, and other social, political, and economic subjects in a dystopian vision of a not-too-future Britain.
