A '''cable car''' is a type of car that runs on cables above the car.  The machines that drive the cables are in the two "winding houses".  One winding house is at the bottom and one at the top.  It is used much in areas where there are a lot of mountains.

The construction of the longest cable way in the world was finished in 16th October 2010 in Armenia. Its name is Wings of Tatev and has length of 5.7&nbsp;km.

Some cable cars run on railway tracks, pulled by a cable.
