'''Julian Paul Assange''' (born 3 July 1971) is an Australian computer programmer, publisher and journalist. He is a spokesman and editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, which is a website that posts news leaks. He started the website in 2006. He was born in Townsville, Queensland. He also made a program called Rubberhose (file system) to hide secret information in a specific way that protects against torture.

Assange was the Readers' Choice for Time Person of the Year in 2010 after getting the most Internet votes. However, Mark Zuckerberg, who started Facebook, won the actual award.

In 2012, facing extradition to Sweden, he was granted political asylum by Ecuador and took refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador, London.

On 11 January 2018, it was announced that Assange had held Ecuadorian citizenship since 12 December 2017.

Ecuadorian President Lenín Moreno said on 27 July 2018 that he had begun talks with British authorities to withdraw the asylum for Assange. His lawyers said they will fight extradition to the United States.
In November 2019, it was reported that Assange is in bad health, has depression and "could die in prison" if not hospitalized.
The extradition to the United States hearing (a pre-trial discussion in a court) for Assange began in London on February 24,  2020. The next set of hearings is scheduled for May.
