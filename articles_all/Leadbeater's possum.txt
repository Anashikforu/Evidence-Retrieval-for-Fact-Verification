'''Leadbeater's possum''' (''Gymnobelideus leadbeateri'') is an endangered species of Australian possum. They need food all year round, and trees with holes where they can hide during the day. They live in mixed-age wet sclerophyll forest with plenty of ''Acacia''.

The possum was once thought to be extinct. It now lives only in small areas of old and mixed age Eucalyptus regnans|mountain ash forest in the central highlands of Victoria, Australia|Victoria, north-east of Melbourne. 

These trees are a species of ''Eucalyptus'': they give off vapour which catches fire easily. About half this area was burnt in the disastrous Black Saturday bushfire in 2009. Large areas of the forest around Marysville, Victoria|Marysville, Narbethong, Victoria|Narbethong and Healesville, Victoria|Healesville were destroyed.
