A '''UFO''' ('''Unidentified Flying Object''') is any object flying in the sky which cannot be :wikt:identify|identified by the person who sees it. Sometimes the object is :wikt:investigate|investigated. If people can still not figure out what the object is after an investigation, it is called a UFO. If they figure out what the object is, it can no longer be called a UFO because it has been identified.

Even though UFOs can be anything, people often use the word ''UFO'' when they are talking about extraterrestrial life|alien spacecraft. '''Flying saucer''' is another word that is often used to describe an unidentified flying object.

 Identified flying objects (IFOs) 
Studies estimate that 50-90% of all reported UFO sightings are identified later. Usually 10-20% are never identified. Studies also show that very few UFO sightings are hoaxes (people trying to trick other people). Most UFOs are actually natural or man-made objects that looked strange.

80-90% of IFOs are identified as one of three different things: 
# astronomy|astronomical causes (for example: planets, stars, or meteors)
# aircraft
# balloons (including weather balloons)

10-20% of IFOs are other causes (such as birds, clouds, wikt:mirage|mirages, searchlights, etc.)
