Image:Basis graph.svg|thumb|This picture illustrates the standard basis in '''''R'''2''. The red and blue vectors are the elements of the basis; the green vector can be given with the basis vectors.
In linear algebra, a '''basis''' is a set of vectors in a given vector space with certain properties:

 One can get any vector in the vector space by multiplying each of the basis vectors by different numbers, and then addition|adding them up.
 If any vector is removed from the basis, the property above is no longer satisfied. 

The dimension of a given vector space is the number of elements of the basis.

Example
If \mathbb{R}^3 is the vector space then:

B=\{(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)\} is a basis of \mathbb{R}^3.

It's easy to see that for any element of \mathbb{R}^3 it can be represented as a combination of the above basis.
Let x be any element of \mathbb{R}^3 and let x=(x_1,x_2,x_3).

Since x_1,x_2 and x_3 are elements of \mathbb{R} then they can be written as x_1=1x_1 and so on.

Then the combination  equals the element x.

This shows that the set B is a basis of \mathbb{R}^3.
