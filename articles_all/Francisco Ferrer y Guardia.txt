In 1906 he was arrested and accused of helping with Mateu Morral's attack on King Alphonso XIII and released a year later.  His school failed and closed while he was incarcerated.

 Works 
Early in the summer of 1908, after his release from jail, he wrote the story of the Modern School. The book was called ''The Origins and Ideals of the Modern School'' and was translated into English by Joseph McCabe and published by the Knickerbocker Press in 1913.

When the martial law was reused in 1909 during the Tragic Week, he was arrested, convicted without any proof and executed by firing squad at Montjuïc|Montjuich Fortress in Barcelona on 13 October.
