A '''macaw''' is a New World parrot. Some of the species are large birds, the largest of the parrots. Macaws are native to Mexico, Central America, South America, and formerly the Caribbean.

Macaws, like all parrots, are unusually intelligent birds. The usual thing for parrots is to pair for life. They stay together even out of the mating season. They often fly in formation, one above the other.

Diet and clay licks



Macaws eat a variety of foods including seeds, nuts, fruits, palm fruits, leaves, flowers, and stems.  Wild species may forage widely, over  for some of the larger species such as ''Ara araurana'' (blue & yellow macaw) and ''Ara ambigua'' (great green macaw), in search of seasonally available foods.  

In the western Amazon Basin|Amazon, hundreds of macaws and other parrots descend to exposed river banks to lick clay almost daily,Munn C.A. 1994. Macaws: winged rainbows.

It was suggested that parrots and macaws in the Amazon basin eat clay from exposed river banks to neutralize toxins.Gilardi J.D. 1996. Ecology of parrots in the Peruvian Amazon: habitat use, nutrition, and geophagy. Ph.D. dissertation. University of California at Davis, Davis, California
