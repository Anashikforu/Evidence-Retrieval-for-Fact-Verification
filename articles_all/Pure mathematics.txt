'''Pure mathematics''' is a field of mathematics. Other fields of mathematics are driven and motivated by applied mathematics|applications, they can be used to solve ''real-world'' problems, for example mathematical physics in physics or engineering. In contrast, pure mathematics studies abstraction|abstract ideas or it tries to make Mathematical proof|proofs more beautiful or easier to understand. 
 Examples 
 Generalizing theorems: Finding a more general theorem can lead to a better understanding of mathematics.
 Generality can also shorten proofs: There no longer is a need to handle special cases. This makes proofs shorter, simpler, and easier to follow or explain.
