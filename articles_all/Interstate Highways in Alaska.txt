There are '''Interstate Highways in Alaska''' that get money from the government. Even though these are Interstate Highways, most of them are not grade separated, which means drivers must use a specially made group of ramps to get to the road. They mostly are along roads with two lanes.  Also, there are no signs for these Interstate Highways. 

The four Interstate Highways in Alaska are:
'''Interstate A1''' goes from Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage to the Canada border. It is  long.'''Interstate A2''' goes from Tok, Alaska|Tok to Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks. It is  long.
'''Interstate A3''' goes from Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage to Soldotna, Alaska|Soldotna. It is  long. 
'''Interstate A4''' goes from Palmer, Alaska|Palmer to Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks. It is  long.
