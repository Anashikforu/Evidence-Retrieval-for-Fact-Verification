The '''Society of Jesus''' (Latin language|Latin: ''Societas Iesu'', ''S.J.'' and ''S.I.'' or ''SJ'', ''SI'' ) is a Roman Catholic Church religion|religious order whose members are called '''Jesuits''', ''Soldiers of Jesus Christ|Christ'', and ''Foot soldiers of the Pope'', because the founder, Saint Ignatius of Loyola, was a knight before becoming a priest.

Jesuits are the largest male religious order of the Roman Catholic Church with 19,216 members (13,491 priests, 3,049 scholastic students, 1,810 brothers and 866 novices).

The Society of Jesus is consecrated under the patron saint|patronage of the Madonna Della Strada.  It is led by a Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Superior General, currently Arturo Sosa.

The headquarters of the society, its Curia|General Curia, is in Rome.

Within the Catholic Church, there has been a sometimes tense relationship between Jesuits and the Holy See|Vatican.  This is due to questioning of official Church teaching and papal directives, such as those on abortion,
However, as of 2013, the current Pope, Pope Francis, is a Jesuit himself.
