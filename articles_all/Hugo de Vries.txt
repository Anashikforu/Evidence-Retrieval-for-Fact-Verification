'''Hugo Marie de Vries''' (Haarlem, 16 February 1848 – Gelderland|Lunteren, 21 May 1935) was a Netherlands|Dutch botanist and one of the first geneticists. He suggested the concept of genes, rediscovered Gregor Mendel's Mendelian laws|laws of heredity, and introduced the term ''mutation''. He developed a mistaken mutation theory of evolution, mainly due to the peculiarities of his favourite organism, the Evening Primrose (''Oenothera lamarckiana'').

Carl Correns also – independently – rediscovered Gregor Mendel's work on genetics. Erich von Tschermak's status as a third rediscoverer is now less convincing.
