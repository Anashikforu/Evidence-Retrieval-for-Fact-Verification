'''Subversion''' is a systematic attempt to overthrow or undermine a government or political system by persons working from within. Subversion works against structures of power, authority, exploitation, servitude, and hierarchy. A '''subversive''' is something or someone that works against an organization or system.

Subversive activity is the lending of aid, comfort, and support to individuals, groups, or organizations that work for the ''overthrow of governments by force and violence''. Actions against the best interests of the government, and which are not treason, sedition, sabotage, or espionage are put in the category of subversive activity.
