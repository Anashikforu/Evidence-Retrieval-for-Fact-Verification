An '''iwan''' ( ''eyvƒÅn'') is defined as a vaulted hall or space, walled on three sides, with one end open.
Iwans were a trademark of the Sassanid architecture of Persia. They then found their way into Islamic architecture. 

Typically, iwans open on to a central courtyard, and have been used in both public and residential architecture.
