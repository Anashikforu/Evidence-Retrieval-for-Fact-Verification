'''D0226''' and '''D0227''' were two prototype diesel shunting locomotives built in 1956 by English Electric at its Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows to demonstrate its wares to British Railways. They originally carried numbers D226 and D227, their Vulcan Foundry works numbers, but these were later amended to avoid clashing with the numbers of new British Rail Class 40|Class 40 locomotives.
