'''Epiphany''' is a Web browser for GNOME. It is also available for Mac OS X and was made from Galeon.

It uses the Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko layout engine from the Mozilla project to show web pages; however, the Epiphany Programmer|developers have a new but less stable version of Epiphany 2.21.4 using the WebKit engine instead of Gecko.
Epiphany was made from Galeon by Marco Pesenti Gritti (also the creator of Galeon) with the aim of making a web browser with a very simple user experience. Because of that, Epiphany does not have its own themes, instead, it uses GNOMEâ€™s settings that are set in the GNOME Control Center.
