'''''Splinter''''' is the seventh album by American punk rock band The Offspring, released in 2003. It was the first album the band released without drummer Ron Welty and even though many of their previous albums contain explicit langugage, it was the first to have a Parental Advisory.

While the album was not as successful as The Offspring's albums between ''Smash (album)|Smash'' and ''Conspiracy of One'', ''Splinter'' received gold certification two months after its release.
