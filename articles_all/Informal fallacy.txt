An '''informal fallacy''' is an logical argument whose  premises fail to support their conclusion.Kelley D. 1994. ''The art of reasoning''. W W Norton.  Informal fallacies often come from errors in reasoning.

In contrast to a formal fallacy, the error has to do with issues of inference. Because natural language|language is used to state the propositions, natural language allows one to say more than  Mathematical logic|formal logic can represent. All informal fallacies of deductive reasoning contain a disconnect between the premises and the conclusion. This  makes the argument validity|invalid. The disconnect happens because there is a hidden co-premise. If this co-premise were ''stated'', it would make the argument valid.

Inductive reasoning|Inductive ''informal'' fallacies are rather different from their deductive counterparts.conclusion link, not the presence of hidden premises. For instance, the fallacy of hasty generalization, can be roughly stated as:


:p) ''S'' is a ''P''
:p) ''S'' is also a ''Q''
:c) therefore, all ''P''s are also ''Q''s


If the populations of ''P'' and ''Q'' are both too large to sample completely, then the statement is induction|inductive. In such a case, a hasty generalization occurs when the number of ''P''s and ''Q''s does not represent the respective populations. It is important to distinguish between a principle of reasoning (deductive or inductive) and the premise of an argument.

Some informal fallacies are fallacies of ambiguity. For example:

: Feathers are '''light'''. ("light" as "not heavy")
: What is '''light''' cannot be dark. ("light" as "containing a lot of white")
: Therefore, feathers cannot be dark.

Equivocations are more difficult to detect in cases where the two meanings are closely related to each other.
