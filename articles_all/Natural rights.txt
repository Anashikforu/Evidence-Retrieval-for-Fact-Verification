'''Natural rights''' are rights that believe it is important for all humans and animals to have out of (natural law.)  These rights are often viewed as inalienable, meaning they can almost never be taken away. The concept of what are natural rights has varied throughout history.  the Americans thought the British were being very unfair. So they created the natural law and the declaration of independence. Then after the declaration was written they created the united states and became a country.The idea first came up in ancient times but was discussed most famously by English philosopher John Locke in the 1600's.  Locke said that the most important natural rights are "Life, Liberty, and Property". In the United States Declaration of Independence, the natural rights mentioned are "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness".  The idea was also found in the Declaration of the Rights of Man. It is viewed by Locke, Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson, and others that the purpose of government is to protect peoples' natural rights through a social contract (an implicit agreement among the members of a society to cooperate for social benefits). There have been many times in history that natural rights have been breached by both governments and singular people.
