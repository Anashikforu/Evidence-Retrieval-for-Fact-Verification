The Royal  Air Force dropped propaganda leaflets on Germany, and Canadian troops began to arrive in Britain. 

In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway.  Both sides began to fight each other again.  Britain and France needed many weapons quickly and so they began to buy them from American weapon companies.  The American government remained neutral but helped Britain and France by selling weapons cheaply and then by Lend-Lease of military equipment and supplies.
