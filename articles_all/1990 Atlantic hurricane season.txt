The '''1990 Atlantic hurricane season''' officially began on June 1, 1990, and lasted until November 30, 1990. However, storms can form outside these dates. For example, Tropical Depression One formed on May 25. This season was very active with two depressions, six tropical storms, seven hurricanes, and one major hurricane. At that time it was the most active hurricane season.

This season was less deadly and damaging than other seasons, with only 116 deaths, and $150 million. The few deaths and little bit of damage were due to the fact that most of the storms were relatively weak, and most of the storms stayed at sea.
