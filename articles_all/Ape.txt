'''Apes''' are mammals belonging to the primate family '''Hominoidea'''. Its members are called '''hominoids'''. They are native to Africa and Southeast Asia. Its living members are divided into two Family (biology)|families:
Hylobatidae, the gibbons and siamangs;
Hominidae, consisting of humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans.Groves, Colin; Wilson D.E. and Reeder D.M. (eds) 2005. ''Mammal species of the world''. 3rd ed, Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 178-184.  
One clear difference between monkeys and apes is that monkeys almost always have tails, but hominoids never do. There are also differences in their tooth|teeth and the way they move their arms. They have a wide degree of freedom at the shoulder joint, which helps them swing by their arms in the trees (brachiation).

The diets of apes are similar to those of other primates. They eat fruits, nuts, seeds, leaves and sometimes other animals. They are generally omnivores, though most of their intake is herbivorous.
