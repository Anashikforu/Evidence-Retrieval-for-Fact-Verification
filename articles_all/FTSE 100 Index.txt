The '''FTSE 100''' (often said 'foot-sie'), now known as FTSE Russell Group, is an important stock exchange in London, United Kingdom, similar to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, in the United States, or the CAC 40, in France. FTSE stands for Financial Times Stock Exchange. The London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) owns the FTSE Russell Group. In addition to the FTSE Russell Group, the LSEG also owns the Borsa Italiana, Millennium IT, and other financial brands. The 100 biggest companies in the United Kingdom are listed on it. The index took the place of the FT30 in January 1984. 

The FTSE 100 is often considered a leading indicator of prosperity for the companies in the U.K. and the U.K. economy in general. As such, it typically draws investors looking for exposure to big U.K. companies. While several of its listings do include companies with homes outside of the U.K., it is most significantly made up of U.K. companies and impacted by U.K. daily developments. 

It is calculated by computers in real time, and the cost of shares in the companies is reported every 15 seconds.
