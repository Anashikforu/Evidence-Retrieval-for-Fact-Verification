 History 


= Early history =
Before the creation of the Kansas Territory, the area was part of the Shawnee people|Shawnee Indian reservation|Reservation.09. Today, Hogback Ridge is called "Mount Oread."

In the first half of the 1800s, there were many arguments about slavery in the United States. During this time, every time a Slave and free states|free state (a state where slavery was illegal) was added into the country, a Slave and free states|slave state (a state where slavery was allowed) had to be added too. The Missouri Compromise continued to let this happen. As a compromise to people arguing about new states being free or slave, Senator Lewis Cass and Senator Stephen A. Douglas wikt:promote|promoted the idea of "popular sovereignty." That meant the people in the area would decide to have slavery or not (instead of politicians in Washington, D.C.|Washington deciding). Popular sovereignty was a big part of the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act. That law undid the Missouri Compromise in practice. The Kansas-Nebraska Act also created the Kansas Territory and the Nebraska Territory.Gilman (1914), pp. 510.

After the law passed, anti-slavery people were worried that the Kansas Territory would become a slave state.Cordley (1895), p. 1. This is because the state next to Kansas is Missouri, which was a slave state. People believed that the first settlers in Kansas would be from Missouri. To stop Missouri from influencing Kansas, anti-slavery people from around the United States came to Kansas. These people wanted to make Kansas a free state.Childers (2011), pp. 48–70.Cordley (1895), pp. 12. These people were called "Free-Stater (Kansas)|free-staters."14.Federal Highway Administration (2002), p. A64.Andreas (1883), p. 308. They told the NEEAC to send people to this place.



While Robinson and Branscomb were exploring, the NEEAC was getting people to move to Kansas. The NEEAC wanted to send a big group of people to claim the land. However, a cholera outbreak in the Missouri River Valley|Missouri Valley stopped this from happening.Andreas (1883), p. 312. The NEEAC was able to get a small group of only 29 men to go. They left Boston, Massachusetts on July 17, 1854. Many people in Boston were happy to see them do this, and they hoped they would do well.Connelly (1918), p. 360. In late July, the group came to St. Louis and met Charles Robinson. He gave them transportation and told them what to do. They came to the Kansas Territory in late July. They ate their first meal on Hogback Ridge on August 1, 1854.Armitage and Lee (1992), p. 5. After they had eaten, half of them left to claim the land around them. The other half stayed on Hogback Ridge. They began putting up their tents between Mount Oread and the Kansas River (close to where Massachusetts Street is). This was the start of the city.Connelly (1918), p. 361.

Four weeks later, Robinson and Samuel C. Pomeroy led a second group of 67 people from Worcester, Massachusetts on August 31. While they were going to Kansas, other anti-slavery people joined them. When they came to Lawrence on September 917. a fifth group on November 20, and a sixth group on December 1.Gilmore (2005), p. 47.

On September 18, 1854, the people of Lawrence made a government. On September 20, they wrote a constitution which did not allow slavery. The people of Lawrence wrote this constitution even though other people near them wanted slavery. On September 30, the people of Lawrence came together to protect Thomas J. Ferril, an anti-slavery clergyman from Missouri. Pro-slavery people went to Ferril's house and threatened violence. The pro-slavery people left when they saw free-state people coming with guns. On October 1, a woman wikt:destroy|destroyed the tent of a free-state man. Pro-slavery people came to stop the settlers from building the tent again, but they built the tent again without violence.

Lawrence was first called "Wakarusa". It also had different names like "New Boston" or "Yankee Town." Some people wanted the city to be called "Lawrence" to honour|honor a man named Amos Adams Lawrence. He was a Republican Party (United States)|Republican businessman who did not like slavery. People believed that if they named the city "Lawrence," he would give financial support to the city. He did.Bisel (2012), p. 32. On October 1, the people voted to name the city Lawrence. On October 17, people started building houses and businesses. Pro-slavery people tried to build houses close to Lawrence, and people from Lawrence hated this. They had a very angry argument. The pro-slavery people threatened violence, but they left. No violence happened.

In early October 1854, Andrew Horatio Reeder, the first List of Governors of Kansas|governor of the Kansas Territory, came to Lawrence. He had a party. He asked everyone to get along. He did not say anything about slavery. The first winter in Lawrence was difficult because it was very cold, and people did not have good houses. Two miles south of Lawrence on November 3, 1854, the first elections were held. At the elections, a man named Henry Davis attacked a pro-slavery man named Lucius Kibbee using a Bowie knife. Kibbee then shot Davis and killed him. This was the first murder in Kansas.


Two newspapers were started in 1854. They were the ''Kansas Pioneer'' and the ''Herald of Freedom''. The writers of the newspapers wrote about their belief that slavery was wrong. State of Kansas|Kansas State Board of Agriculture (1878), pp. 187-191.

At the start of 1855, the free-staters and the pro-slavery people around Lawrence started fighting for political power. At the Kansas elections on March 30, 1855, about 700-1,000 pro-slavery people from Missouri voted at the election. They came in more than 100 wikt:wagon|wagons. They had guns, rifles, pistols, and Bowie knives. They also brought two pieces of artillery.Cordley (1895), p. 3031. No one argued with them because there were a lot of them. They went back to Missouri the next day. Before the election, the government did a census which showed that 8,601 people lived in Kansas. Of those 2,905 were voters; Lawrence had 369 voters.Cordley (1895), p. 28. There were a total of 2,905 voters in the territory, but there were 6,307 votes counted. 1,034 votes were cast in Lawrence, but 802 were from people who did not live in Kansas. Only 232 of the votes were real.Cordley (1895), p. 32. At the election, a man named Silas Bond was shot at, and he ran away. He was shot at because he was "an wikt:obnoxious|obnoxious free-state man."

On August 27, 1855, the pro-slavery people were happy when the Governor of Kansas|Governor Daniel Woodson chose a pro-slavery man, Samuel J. Jones, to be the Douglas County, Kansas|county sheriff.

In June 1855, the people of Lawrence had a meeting and decided to wikt:resist|resist any laws the Kansas legislature passed. They believed the legislature was elected by armed Missouri people, not Kansas people. Amos Lawrence and others sent crates full of rifles. They wrote on the crates that the things inside were books because "the border ruffians had no use for books," so they did not take the rifles when they came to Lawrence.Cordley (1895), p. 37. Horace Greeley helped send a howitzer to Lawrence.

On November 21, 1855, the pro-slavery man Franklin N. Coleman shot anti-slavery man Charles Dow in the head. This killed him.56.

Sacking of Lawrence

Wilson Shannon, the governor of the Kansas Territory, saw that the people were becoming very angry and violent. He asked the Kansas militia to come and keep the peace. Shannon wanted the people in the militia to be from Kansas, but Samuel Jones brought 1,200-1,500 men from Missouri.Litteer (1987), pp. 1314. When the people of Lawrence learned this, they made a militia of 600-800 men. They chose Robinson to lead the militia. James H. Lane was chosen as his second-in-command. John Brown and his four sons also joined to fight. Both groups were ready to fight, but they could not because the winter was very cold. Wilson Shannon decided to wikt:prevent|prevent a fight. He demanded that the leaders of both sides agree to a peace treaty. They did, and the men from Missouri went back to Missouri.75. This "war" is known as the Wakarusa War.



In spring 1856, pro-slavery people wanted to make the free-staters weak. The pro-slavery people said that the ''Herald of Freedom'' newspaper, the ''Kansas Free State'' newspaper, and the Eldridge Hotel were very bad. On April 23, 1856, Samuel Jones came to Lawrence. He tried to arrest some anti-slavery people who had created their own anti-slavery government. A sniper shot Samuel Jones, but he did not die. The people of Lawrence made Jones leave.Connelley (2018) 1900, p. 53. On May 11, Federal Marshall (like a police officer but for the entire country) Israel B. Donaldson said that people wikt:interfere|interfered with Samuel Jones which was not legal.Ball (2001), p. 174. A Kansas grand jury agreed.

Anti-slavery capital
In 1855 and 1857, Lawrence got a charter (a document that wikt:official|officially creates a town) from the pro-slavery Kansas government. The people of Lawrence resisted the Kansas government because they believed they were too pro-slavery.
