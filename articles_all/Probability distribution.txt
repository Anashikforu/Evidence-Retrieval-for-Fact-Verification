'''Probability distribution''' is a term from mathematics. Suppose there are many events with random outcomes. A probability distribution is the theoretical counterpart to the frequency distribution. A frequency distribution simply shows how many times a certain event occurred. A probability distribution says how many times it ''should'' have occurred in the long run (that is, its probability). The probability distribution of a random variable X is often written as f_X(x) (or simply f(x)).

As an example, the probability distribution for a single roll of a normal 6-sided dice can be presented by:

where result is the outcome of the dice roll, and the probability shows the chances of that result occurring. If we roll a dice 60 times, then in the long run, we should expect to have each side appear 10 times on average. 

There are different probability distributions. Each of them has its use, its benefits and its drawbacks. Some common probability distributions include:

 Binomial distribution
 Cauchy distribution
 Chi-square distribution
 Exponential distribution
 Gumbel distribution
 Normal distribution 
 Poisson distribution
 Student's t-distribution
