'''London City Airport DLR station''' is a station on the Docklands Light Railway which serves the London City Airport, and which opened in 2 December 2005. It is on the King George V DLR station|King George V branch. Trains run westbound to Bank and Monument stations|Bank in the City of London and eastbound to Woolwich Arsenal DLR station|Woolwich Arsenal.

Until the extension to Woolwich Arsenal this station was the main reason for this branch.  It continues to be an important station on the DLR.  It has an excellent direct covered connection with adjacent airport terminal building.  Although the station maintains the DLR philosophy of basic good design it makes various concessions to cater for airport passengers including a fully enclosed waiting room on the central island platform.

The station is in the London Borough of Newham and is in Travelcard Zone 3.
