A '''radian''' is a unit of measuring angles. It is shown by the symbol "rad" or, less often, c (for circular measure). The radian was once an SI supplementary unit, but was changed to a derived unit in 1995.

Usage
Most people who do mathematics or physics use radians, rather than degree (angle)|degrees, because some kinds of calculations, mostly in trigonometry and calculus, are simpler when using radians rather than degrees. Thus, most calculations related to angular frequency (such as angular velocity) use radians per second. 

People who look through a telescope or sniper scope often use milliradians to describe distances as seen through it.

Conversion
1 radian is equal to about 57.3°. There are 2Pi (mathematical constant)|π radians (about 6.28 radians) in a full circle.
:2\pi\mbox{ rad} = 360^\circ
:1 \mbox{ rad} = \frac {360^\circ} {2 \pi} = \frac {180^\circ} {\pi} \approx 57.29577951^\circ 

or:

:360^\circ=2\pi\mbox{ rad}
:1^\circ=\frac{2\pi}{360}\mbox{ rad}=\frac{\pi}{180}\mbox{ rad} \approx 0.01745329\mbox{ rad}

we can also say that:

:x \mbox{ rad} = \left(\frac{180x}{\pi}\right)^\circ.
