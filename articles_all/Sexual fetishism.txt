'''Sexual fetishism''' (also ''erotic fetishism'' or ''fetish'') is sexual arousal caused by an object or body part that is not normally thought of as sexual.

Examples of common or well-known fetishes include Foot fetishism|feet and footwear (shoes, socks), rubber, BDSM|bondage, furry or cross-dressing.

Partialism

'''Partialism''' is a type of sexual fetishism where the sexual want of a body part is more than the sexual want of the person who has the body part. Martin Kafka states that partialism is not exactly the same as fetishism, although common use does not agree.
