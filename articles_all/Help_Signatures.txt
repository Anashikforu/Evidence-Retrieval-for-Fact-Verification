Users can easily '''sign''' their posts at the end of a comment. The common format to type a signature â€“ two hyphens (or a dash) followed by four tildes (-- '''~~~~'''). This comes from the computer network Usenet, where two hyphens mark a signature block. The tildes automatically change to the actual username (linked to the right user page etc.) and timestamp (time/date), when you save a signed edit. This helps other users to follow the timing order of discussions, and to find the author of a particular comment. Signing is normally done on Help:Talk pages|talk pages only, not on written articles. Signatures do not work in edit summaries (they do not change from ~~~~ to your username).

If you edit without logging in, your IP address will take the place of your username.

 Normal signature options 

There are three options. Four tildes are standard (full signature). Typing three tildes results in a username-only signature (without timestamp). Typing five tildes results in a pure timestamp (without username).
