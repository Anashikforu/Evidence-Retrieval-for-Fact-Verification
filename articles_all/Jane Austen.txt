 Biography 
Biography|Biographical facts about Jane Austen are "famously scarce" (few).Fergus, "Biography", ''Jane Austen in Context'', 3–4. Only a few letters remain (it is estimated that only 160 out of Austen's 3,000 letters survive).Le Faye, "Letters", ''Jane Austen in Context'', 33. Her sister Cassandra Austen|Cassandra (to whom most of the letters were written) burned "the greater part" of the ones she kept. The letters she did not destroy she wikt:censor|censored.Le Faye, ''A Family Record'', 270; Nokes, 1. Other letters were destroyed by the wikt:heir|heirs of Admiral Francis Austen, Jane's brother.Le Faye, ''A Family Record'', 279. Most of the biographies written about her for 50 years after she died was by her relatives, who often described her as "good quiet Aunt Jane". Scholars have not been able to find much information after that.

= Family =


Austen's parents, George Austen (1731–1805), and his wife, Cassandra (1739–1827), were both part of the gentry.Honan, 29–30. Cassandra was a part of the important Baron Leigh|Leigh family. George Austen, however, was of a lower class of society. He had first met Cassandra at Oxford, while she was meeting her uncle Theophilus.Helen Amy, "Jane Austen", 9–10. George and Cassandra marriage|married on 26 April 1764 at Walcot Church in Bath (city)|Bath.Tomalin, 6, 13–16, 147–51, 170–71; Greene, "Jane Austen and the Peerage", ''Jane Austen: A Collection of Critical Essays'', 156-57; Fergus, "Biography", ''Jane Austen in Context'', 5–6; Collins, 10–11.

Austen had a large family. She had six brothers—James (1765–1819), George (1766–1838), Edward (1767–1852), Henry Thomas (1771–1850), Francis William (Frank) (1774–1865), Charles John (1779–1852)—and one sister, Cassandra Austen|Cassandra Elizabeth (1773–1845), who died without marrying. Jane deeply loved Cassandra, and they were both best friends.Fergus, "Biography", 3; Tomalin, 142; Honan, 23, 119. Of her brothers, Austen was most close to Henry, who helped spread and influence her writing.MacDonagh, 50–51; Honan, 24, 246; Collins, 17. "Oh, what a Henry!" she once wrote.Tomalin, ''Jane Austen: A Life'', 80. George was almost ten years older than Jane. He suffered from fits and was not able to develop normally.Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 22.Tomalin, ''Jane Austen: A Life'', 9. His father wrote of him, "We have this comfort, he cannot be a bad or a wicked child". He may also have been deaf and mute. Jane knew sign language (she mentioned talking "with my fingers" in a letter) and could have communicated with him. Charles and Frank served in the navy. Edward was adoption|adopted by his fourth cousin, Thomas Knight. He became "Edward Knight" instead of Edward Austen in 1812.Tucker, "Jane Austen's Family", 147; Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 43–44.

= Early life and education =
Austen was born on 16 December 1775 at Steventon rectory. She was Infant baptism|christened at home and then, as the Book of Common Prayer directs, brought to church for the baptism to be certified in public on 5 April 1776.Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 27. A few months after she was born, her mother hired a woman named Elizabeth Littlewood to wet nurse|nurse her. Littlewood took care of Austen for about a year.Tomalin, 7–9; Honan, 21–22; Collins, 86; Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 19. Le Faye and Collins add that the Austens followed this custom for all of their children. According to family wikt:tradition|tradition, Jane and Cassandra were sent to Oxford to be educated by Mrs. Ann Crawley in 1783. They moved with her to Southampton later in the year. Both girls caught typhus and Jane almost died.Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 47–49; Collins, 35, 133. After that, Austen was educated at home until she went to boarding school with Cassandra early in 1785. She learned some French language|French, writing|spelling, sewing|needlework, dance|dancing,music, and probably drama. In the winter of 1786, Jane and Cassandra went back home.

Austen also learned much by reading books. Her father and brothers helped choose the books she read.Le Faye, "Chronology", 2–3; Grundy, "Jane Austen and Literary Traditions", 190-91; Tomalin, 28–29, 33–43, 66–67; Honan, 31–34; Lascelles, 7–8. Irene Collins believes that Austen "used some of the same school books as the boys" her father tutored. Collins, 42. George Austen seemed to have let his daughters read the books in his large library freely. He also allowed Austen's experiments in writing, and gave her costly paper and other writing materials.Honan, 66–68; Collins, 43.

Jane Austen and her family also enjoyed acting out drama|plays privately.Le Faye, "Chronology", 2–3; Tucker, "Amateur Theatricals at Steventon", ''The Jane Austen Companion'', 1–2; Byrne, 1–39; Gay, ix, 1; Tomalin, 31–32, 40–42, 55–57, 62–63; Honan, 35, 47–52, 423–24, n. 20. Most of the plays were comedy|comedies. This might have been a way for Austen's comedic and satire|satirical talents to develop.Honan, 53–54; Lascelles, 106-07; Litz, 14–17.

= Early writings =

Perhaps from as early as 1787, Austen began writing poems, short stories, and plays for fun.Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 66; Litz, "Chronology of Composition", ''The Jane Austen Companion'', 48; Honan, 61–62, 70; Lascelles, 4. Austen later put together "fair copies" of 29 of these early works into three notebooks. They are now called the ''Juvenilia''. It has pieces which were first written down between 1787 and 1793.Honan, 62–76; Le Faye, ''A Family Record'', 270. Jane Austen had arranged her writing during this time into three volumes, namely ''Volume the First'', ''Volume the Second'' and ''Volume the Third''.Helen Amy, "Jane Austen", 29. There is some proof that Austen continued to work on these pieces later in life. Her nephew and niece, James Edward and Anna Austen, may have made further additions to her work in around 1814.Sutherland, 14; Doody, "The Short Fiction", ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', 85–86. In these works were included ''Love and Freindship''  which was completed in 1790 and ''Lesley Castle'' which was completed in 1792. In ''Love and Freindship'', she laughed at popular sentimental novels.Litz, 21; Tomalin, 47; Honan, 73–74; Southam, "Juvenilia", ''The Jane Austen Companion'', 248-49. She also wrote ''The History of England'', which had 13 watercolor painting|watercolour pictures by her sister Cassandra inside it.

=Death=
Jane Austen started to feel increasingly unwell during 1816, which was the year when her novel '''Persuasion' ''was published. On 24 May 1817, she moved to Winchester in search for a cure to her illness. She died on 18 July 1817, aged 41. Although there is no conclusive evidence to prove the cause of her death, it seems likely that it was Addison's disease that killed her. She was buried in Winchester Cathedral on 24 July 1817.
