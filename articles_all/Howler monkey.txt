'''Howler monkeys''', genus ''Alouatta'', are one of the largest New World monkeys. There are 15 species. They are native to South America|South and Central American forests.Groves C.P; Wilson D.E. & Reeder D.M. (eds) 2005. ''Mammal species of the world''. 3rd ed, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, pp. 148â€“152. 

These monkeys are famous for their loud howls, which can travel three miles (4.8&nbsp;km) through dense forest. They are the loudest monkey and may be the loudest land animal. Group males call at dawn and dusk, and at times during the day. The function of howling may relate to intergroup spacing and territory protection.

These social primates live high in the trees (the Canopy (biology)|canopy) of the rain forests of Central America, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Brazil, northern Argentina, and Bolivia. Howlers have a life span of about 20 years. They are in decline due to a loss of habitat.
