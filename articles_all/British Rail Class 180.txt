They are part of the Alstom Coradia|Coradia 1000 family, along with the British Rail Class 175|Class 175. After recurring technical problems with the trains, FGW handed them all back to leasing company Angel Trains in 2008/09. After a period in store, they were leased to Hull Trains and Grand Central (train operating company)|Grand Central, while the remaining five units returned to service with FGW.
