'''Coconut milk''' is a sweet, milky white liquid for cooking. It comes from the meat of a mature coconut. The color and rich taste of the milk are because of the high oil content and sugars. It is different from coconut water (coconut juice), which is the natural liquid found inside a coconut. Coconut milk is used in many tropical recipes. There are two kinds of coconut milk: thick and thin. 

Milk is what female Mammal|mammals make to feed their babies. Coconut milk can therefore not be called milk in the strict sense of the term.
