'''Penicillin''' is a common antibiotic, used to treat bacterial infections. It was one of the first to be discovered, and worked well against staphylococcus|staphylococci and streptococcus|streptococci. Many strains of bacteria are now antibiotic resistance|resistant. Chemists keep changing part of its structure in the effort to keep it working against the bacteria.

Penicillin was discovered by Scotland|Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming|Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928, but it was not mass-produced until  1940.Wainwright M. & Swan H.T. 1986. C.G. Paine and the earliest surviving clinical records of penicillin therapy. ''Medical History'' '''30''' (1): 42â€“56. 
Penicillin is sometimes used to treat syphilis, tonsillitis, meningitis, and pneumonia as well as other diseases. It was first used widely during World War II.

Penicillin was discovered when Fleming noticed a mold that was stopping bacteria from growing in a petri dish.  Australian scientist Howard Florey|Howard Walter Florey made the penicillin mold into a medicine. Together with another scientist Ernst Chain|Ernst Boris Chain, Fleming and Florey were given the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1945.

Some people are allergy|allergic to penicillin. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, or rash. Rarely, patients who are allergic to penicillin get a fever, vomit, or have serious skin irritation.  Because it is such a popular antibiotic, penicillin is the most common cause of serious allergic reactions to a drug. They are now used regularly in hospitals.

 Total synthesis 
Chemist John C. Sheehan at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) did the first chemical synthesis of penicillin in 1957.
