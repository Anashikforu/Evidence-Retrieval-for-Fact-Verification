'''Fort-Liberté''' (Haitian Creole|Kréyòl: ''Fòlibète''; English language|English: "Fort Liberty") is a city in northeast Haiti, on the Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast. It is the Capital (city)|capital city of the Nord-Est Department|Nord-Est ''Departments of Haiti|Département''.

The city is on the ''Baie de Fort-Liberté'' ("Fort-Liberté Bay") about 56&nbsp;km east of Cap-Haïtien and to the west of the Dominican Republic. It is also the chief town of an ''arrondissement'' (a part of a department) with the same name. The ''arrondissement'' has three ''communes'' (a ''commune'' is like a municipality): Fort-Liberté, Ferrier (Kreyòl: ''Ferye'') and Perches (Kreyòl: ''Opèch'').

History
Between 1503 and 1505, Nicolás de Ovando, Spanish governor of the Hispaniola, founded the town of ''Puerto Real'' (English language|English, "Royal Port") where is the present town of "Caracol", to the west of Fort-Liberté. But soon this town was abandoned and the people moved to the east, founding in 1578 a new town with the Taíno name of the region: '''Bayajá'''.

In 1606, those persons living in the old Spain|Spanish towns of Bayajá and Yaguana had, by orders of the Spanish king, to move to the eastern part of the island, to a new town called Bayaguana, combining the two old names.

Later, when France|French people founded a new town in this place, they called it '''Fort-Dauphin''' in 1731, named after the "Dauphin" (the "Dolphin", son of the French king Louis XV of France|Louis XV). When the French Republic was founded, the name was changed to ''Fort-Liberté'' in 1792. After Henri Christophe became King Henri I of Haiti in 1811, he renamed the city '''Fort-Royal'''. In 1820, after the death of Christophe, the name was changed back to Fort Liberté.
