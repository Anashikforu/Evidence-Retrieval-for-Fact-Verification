'''''Amborella trichopoda''''' is a small, evergreen shrub. It occurs only in the moist, shaded understory of montane forests on the South Pacific island of New Caledonia. The genus is the only member of the family (biology)|family '''Amborellaceae''' and contains only this single species.Große-Veldmann, Bernadette ''et al'' 2011. Amborella trichopoda — cultivation of the most ancestral angiosperm in botanic gardens. ''Journal of Botanic Garden Horticulture'' '''9''': 143–155.

''Amborella'' is of great interest to plant systematics|systematists because molecular phylogeny|molecular phylogenetic analyses put it at or near the Basal|base of the flowering plant lineage.Soltis, Pamela S. & Soltis, Douglas E. 2013. Angiosperm phylogeny: a framework for studies of genome evolution. In Leitch, Ilia J. ''et al'' ''Plant genome diversity''. vol 2, Springer, pp. 1–11. Pillon, Yohan 2008.

Since ''Amborella'' is apparently basal among the flowering plants, the features of early flowering plants can be inferred. This is done by comparing derived traits shared by other angiosperms but not present in ''Amborella''. These traits are assumed to have evolved after the divergence of the ''Amborella'' lineage.

The Amborellaceae are a line of flowering plants that diverged very early on (about 130 million years ago) from all the other living species of flowering plants. Among living flowering plants, it is the sister group to all other flowering plants.
