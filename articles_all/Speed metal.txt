'''Speed metal''' is an sub-genre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from New Wave of British Heavy Metal|NWOBHM and hardcore punk roots. It is described by ''Allmusic'' as "extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding" music.

Mot√∂rhead is often credited as the first band to invent/play speed metal.

Speed metal eventually evolved into thrash metal. Although many tend to equate the two subgenres, there is a distinct difference between them. In his book ''Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal'', Ian Christe states that "...thrash metal relies more on long, wrenching rhythmic breaks, while speed metal... is a cleaner and more musically intricate subcategory, still loyal to the dueling melodies of classic metal."
