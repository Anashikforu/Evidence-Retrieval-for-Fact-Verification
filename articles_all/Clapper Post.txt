'''Clapper Post''' () was an urban postal service, which existed in Vienna (since 1772), capital of Austria, and in other cities of that country. Its name refers to an instrument, ''clapper'' (type of a rattle), into which a mailman struck, notifying about his arrival. In Vienna, Clapper Post existed more than ten years.
