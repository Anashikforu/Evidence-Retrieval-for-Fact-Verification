The facilities
The station has 17 platforms, numbered 1 to 17, and arranged in two groups. Platform 1, the northernmost platform. The station's main entrance is from St. John's Hill, into a foot tunnel which is 15&nbsp;ft (4.6&nbsp;m) wide. It runs under the eastern end of the 17 platforms, and to a northern exit, which has restricted opening hours. The foot tunnel becomes very crowded during the morning and evening rush hours, and ticket barriers at the end of the tunnel are a particular pinch point.

A covered footbridge connects the platforms at their western end. The footbridge does not have an exit to or from the station.

The Junction
The station is named Clapham Junction because it is close to the joining point of a number of major rail linesâ€”although the name is not shared by any junction near the station. The names of the nearby rail junctions are:
 Falcon Jn
 Ludgate GW Jn
 Latchmere Jns
 West London Jn
 Pouparts Jn
