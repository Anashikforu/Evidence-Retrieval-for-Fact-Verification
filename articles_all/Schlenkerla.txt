'''Schlenkerla''' is a famous old brewery and tavern in Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany. It is known for its smoked beer which is called "Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier" ("real Schlenkerla smoked beer").  It is a strong, darkish beer with a slightly smokey taste which is rather like bacon.  The alcohol content is 5.1%.  There is another speciality which is called "Urbock" ("Ur" means "original" and "Bock" is actually a male goat).  The Urbock is stronger: 6.5% alcohol and is only served in the season known as the "Starkbierzeit" ("Strong beer time") which is from October to 6 January.  The beer is served from oak barrels.  This is a very old tradition which is not often found nowadays.

The name Schlenkerla comes from the word "schlenken" which means: "to dangle" ("to hang loosely", or "swing").
