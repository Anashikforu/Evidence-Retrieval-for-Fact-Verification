In classical times, this term was used to describe blue pigments, particularly mixtures of copper and cobalt|cobaltous oxides, called genuine cerulean. These early attempts to create sky blue colours were often less than satisfactory due to greenish hues and lack of Fugitive pigments|permanence. When the artificial pigment cerulean blue was invented people started using this instead.
