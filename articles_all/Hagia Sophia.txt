'''Hagia Sophia''' (Greek: Ἁγία Σοφία) is a religious building that was first built as a church in the European side of Istanbul, Turkey.

The present building, now a mosque, was the third church building on the site. The third Hagia Sophia was built between 532 and 537, as the cathedral of Constantinople, the capital city of the Roman Empire in Late Antiquity. The Roman emperor Justinian the Great ordered the construction. The architects were Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus. The Ancient Greek|Greek historian Procopius wrote about Hagia Sophia's construction. The building's roof (a large dome) fell down not long after the church was complete. Justinian again ordered the church's completion. The dome broke apart and has been rebuilt many times, but the walls and floor of the building are the same as those of Justinian's time. The decorations, including mosaics and Fresco|frescoes, are mostly from the Middle Ages.

After an earthquake, Trdat the Architect finished rebuilding it again in 994. It was used as an Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox cathedral until 1453, except when it was the Roman Catholic cathedral between 1204 and 1261. The Ottoman Empire|Ottoman sultan and caliph Mehmed II|Mehmed the Conqueror converted Hagia Sophia into a mosque in 1453 after the Fall of Constantinople.

It became a museum in 1935 after the decision of the secularism|secularist Turkish government under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Kemal Atatürk in 1934. In July 2020, the Islamism|Islamist Turkish government under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Tayyip Erdoğan ordered the Hagia Sophia to be turned back into a mosque following a supreme court annulment of a 1934 presidential decree that made it a museum.
