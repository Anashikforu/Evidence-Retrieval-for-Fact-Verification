 PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT NOTE 

Note: PLEASE DO NOT update this wiki page until the (very) end of the current NHL season (even if 'your' team has already mathematically 'made' it!). The reason for this is to have all the teams known for all the 1st playoff round series, because in some years, the playoff teams aren't decided until the final weekend of the season. Wikipedia's purpose is not to provide up-to-the-minute statistics and these lists can get confusing if editors are changing this page constantly.

NOTE: Also, when you do update the tables, please update the NHL season reference in the this header as well.
