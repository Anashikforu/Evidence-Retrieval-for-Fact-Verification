A '''pet''' is a domestication|domesticated animal that lives with people, but is not forced to Labour (economics)|work and is not eaten, in most instances. In most cases, a pet is kept to entertain people or for companionship. Some pets such as dogs and cats are placed in an animal shelter if there is no one willing to take care of them. If no one adopts it or the pet is too old/sick, the pet may be euthanized.

Dogs, cats, fish, rodents, lagomorphs, ferrets, birds, certain Reptile|reptiles and Amphibian|amphibians, and a wide variety of Arthropod|arthropods such as Tarantula|tarantulas and Hermit crab|hermit crabs are the most common pets in North America.  Horses, elephants, oxen, and donkeys are usually made to work, so they are not usually called pets.  Some dogs also do work for people, and it was once common for some birds (like falcons and carrier pigeons) to work for humans.

Rodents are also very popular pets. The most common are guinea pigs, rabbits, hamsters (especially Syrian hamster|Syrian and dwarf hamsters), mouse|mice and rats.
