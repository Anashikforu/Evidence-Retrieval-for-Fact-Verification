'''Hendrik Antoon Lorentz''' (18 July 1853 – 4 February 1928) was a Netherlands|Dutch physicist. In 1902, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics together with Pieter Zeeman for the discovery and theoretical explanation of the Zeeman effect. He also derived the Lorentz transformation|transformation equations that were later used by Albert Einstein to describe space and time.

Lorentz and general relativity
Lorentz was one of few scientists who supported Einstein's search for general relativity from the beginning – he wrote several research papers and discussed with Einstein personally and by letter. For instance, he attempted to combine Einstein's formalism with Hamilton's principle (1915).

=Death=
In January 1928, Lorentz became seriously ill, and died shortly after on February 4.
