The '''Mount Cayley volcanic field''' is a volcano|volcanic area on the south coast of British Columbia, Canada. It is  long. The field gets its name from Mount Cayley, the biggest of several active volcanos in the area.

Most of the volcanoes there were created when material from inside the earth spilled onto the surface. Under the earth were layers of Glacier|glacial ice from the last ice age. There are tuya—steep, flat-topped volcanoes—and lava domes. The first eruptions in the field occurred between 1.6&nbsp;and 5.3&nbsp;million years ago, and at least 23&nbsp;eruptions have occurred in all.

The southern area has the most known volcanoes—11. The center of the field has at least five volcanoes, and the north has two volcanoes.
