'''Berkelium''' (International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA: ) is a synthetic, Radioactive decay|radioactive, chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol '''Bk''' and atomic number 97. It is a metallic element and part of the actinide series. Berkelium was invented by scientists and does not exist in nature. Berkelium was first made by hitting americium with alpha particles or helium ions. It is named after Berkeley, California and the University of California, Berkeley.

 Uses 
Its only uses are to create bigger elements and research.<!-- Notable characteristics 
Weighable amounts of 249Bk (half-life 314 days) make it possible to determine some of its properties using macroscopic quantities.  As of 2004 it had not been isolated in its elemental form, but it is predicted to be a silvery metal that would easily oxidation|oxidize in air at elevated temperatures and would be solubility|soluble in dilute mineral acids.-->
2), berkelium fluoride (BkF3), berkelium oxychloride (BkOCl), and berkelium trioxide (BkO3). In 1962 visible amounts of berkelium chloride (BkCl3) were isolated that weighed 3 billionths of a gram. This was the first time visible amounts of a pure berkelium compound were produced.-->

<!--History 
Berkelium was discovery of the chemical elements|first synthesized by Glenn T. Seaborg, Albert Ghiorso, Stanley G. Thompson, and Kenneth Street, Jr at the University of California, Berkeley in December 1949. The team used a cyclotron to bombard a milligram-sized target of 241americium|Am with alpha particles to produce 243Bk (half-life 4.5 hours) and two free neutrons. One of the longest lived isotopes of the element, 249Bk (half-life 330 days), was later synthesized by subjecting a 244curium|Cm target with an intense beam of neutrons.-->
<!-- Isotopes 
19 radioisotopes of berkelium have been characterized, with the most stable being 247Bk with a half-life of 1380 years, 248Bk with a half-life of >9 years, and 249Bk with a half-life of 330 days.  All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 5 days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 5 hours. This element also has 2 meta states, with the most stable being 248mBk (tÂ½ 23.7 hours). The isotopes of berkelium range in atomic weight from 235.057 atomic mass unit|u (235Bk) to 254.091 u (254Bk).-->
