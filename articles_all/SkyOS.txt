'''SkyOS''' is a privately-owned operating system currently in production. SkyOS is mostly POSIX-compliant. It comes with the core of the open source GNU tools, including GCC.

Due to its level of POSIX-compliance and port of the GTK+ widget toolkit, many Linux or other UNIX applications have been ported, including AbiWord and Gaim, as well as a few games, such as ''Quake (video game)|Quake''.

It was made by Robert Szeleney.
