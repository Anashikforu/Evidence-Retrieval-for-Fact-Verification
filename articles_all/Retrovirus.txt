A '''retrovirus''' is any virus which copies itself as part of the cell's DNA by transcription (genetics)|reverse transcribing its RNA.  Since the cell cannot proofread the step in which RNA is converted back to DNA, errors often go unnoticed.  This changes the exact sequence of a retrovirus' RNA frequently.  This makes it harder for retroviruses to be attacked by drugs.

HIV is a retrovirus, which makes it very difficult to overcome using drugs.
