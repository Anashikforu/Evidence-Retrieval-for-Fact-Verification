'''''Homo erectus''''' (Latin: "upright man") is an extinction|extinct species of the genus ''Homo (genus)|Homo''.Dutch anatomist Eugene Dubois (1890s) first described it as ''Pithecanthropus erectus'', based on a skullcap and a modern-looking thigh bone found from the bank of a river in Java. Most of the early discoveries were at Zhoukoudian in China. Fossil remains were found in Java (1890s) and in China (1921). Nearly all of them were lost during World War II, but there are casting|casts that are considered to be reliable evidence.

Early in the 20th century it was believed that the first modern humans lived in Asia. But during the 1950s and 1970s, many fossil finds from East Africa (Kenya) showed that the oldest Human|hominins came from there.''H. erectus'' may be a descendant of earlier hominins such as  ''H. habilis''. However, ''H. habilis'' and ''H. erectus'' may have lived at the same time and have come from a common ancestor. 

 Some characteristics 
''H. erectus'' had a cranial capacity (Vertebrate brain#Brain size|brain size) greater than that the earlier ''Homo habilis''. The earliest ''H. erectus'' remains have a cranial capacity of 850&nbsp;cm³, while the latest Javan specimens measure up to 1100&nbsp;cm³.''Java Man'', Curtis, Swisher and Lewin, . This overlaps that of ''H. sapiens'': the frontal bone is less sloped and the dental arcade smaller than in australopithecines. The face is more vertical (less protrusive) than either the australopithecines or ''H. habilis'', with large brow-ridges and less prominent cheekbones.

These early hominins stood about ,

The sexual dimorphism between males and females was slightly greater than modern man, with males being about 25% larger than females. The discovery of the skeleton KNM-WT 15000, "Turkana boy" (''Homo ergaster''), made near Lake Turkana, Kenya by Richard Leakey and Kamoya Kimeu in 1984, is one of the most complete hominid-skeletons discovered, and has contributed greatly to the interpretation of human physiological evolution.

 Tools 
The most distinctive tool of erectus was the Acheulean hand axe, first invented 1.8 million years ago (mya). This hand axe was made by chipping a suitable stone with a hammer stone. Later, the neanderthals used a soft hammer made of deer antler bone to make better tools. The Acheulean hand axe lasted for over a million years as the main tool. Its main use was for butchering meat. This we know because different uses leave different micro-wear on the hand axe surfaces.Haten N. 2010.

 Descendants and subspecies 
''Homo erectus'' remains one of the most successful and long-lived species of the ''Homo'' genus.  It is generally considered to have given rise to a number of descendant species and subspecies. The oldest known specimen of the ancient human was found in southern Africa.

= Recent research =
Fossil ''H. erectus'' skulls found in Java in the 1930s have recently been redated. There are 12 skullcaps (top part of skull) and two lower leg bones. The recent research shows that on Java, ''H. erectus'' survived to about 100,000 years ago. The research gives a definitive age of between 117,000 and 108,000 years ago. That is much a much longer survival than in any other part of the world, so far as is known.Rincon, Paul 2019. ''Homo erectus'': ancient humans survived longer than we thought.
