The '''Pasiphaë group''' is a group of retrograde non-Sphere|spherical moons of Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Pasiphaë (moon)|Pasiphaë and are thought of have a common origin.

Their semi-major axis|semi-major axes (distances from Jupiter) range between 22,800,000 and 24,100,000&nbsp;km (the same range as the Carme group), their inclinations between 144.5° and 158.3°, and their orbital eccentricity|eccentricities between 0.25 and 0.43.

An object's position on the horizontal axis indicates its distance from Jupiter. The vertical axis indicates its orbital inclination|inclination. Orbital eccentricity|Eccentricity is indicated by yellow bars illustrating the object's maximum and minimum distances from Jupiter. Circles illustrate an object's size in comparison to the others.
Core members of the group include (from the biggest to the smallest):

The International Astronomical Union (IAU) reserves names ending in '''-e''' for all retrograde moons, including this group's members.

Origin
The Pasiphaë group is believed to have been formed when Jupiter captured an asteroid which broke up after a collision. The original asteroid was not disturbed heavily: the original body is calculated to have been 60&nbsp;km in diameter, about the same size as Pasiphaë; Pasiphaë has 99% of the original body's mass. However, if Sinope (moon)|Sinope belongs to the group, the amount is much smaller, 87%. 
However, Nesvorny 2003, while concurring on the Ananke and Carme groups, lists only Megaclithe for Pasiphaë's group

The differences of colour between the objects (grey for Pasiphaë, light red for Callirrhoe (moon)|Callirrhoe and Megaclite (moon)|Megaclite) also suggest that the group could have a more complex origin than a single collision.

The horizontal axis illustrates their average distance from Jupiter, the vertical axis their orbital inclination, and the circles their relative sizes.
