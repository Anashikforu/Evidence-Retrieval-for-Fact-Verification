The '''Fibonacci numbers''' are a sequence of numbers in mathematics named after Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci. Fibonacci wrote a book in 1202, called ''Liber Abaci'' ("Book of Calculation"), which introduced the number pattern to Western European mathematics, although mathematicians in India already knew about it.Parmanand Singh.

Historia Mathematica 12(3), 229â€“44, 1985. 

The first number of the pattern is 0, the second number is 1, and each number after that is equal to adding the two numbers right before it together. For example 0+1=1 and 3+5=8.  This sequence goes on forever.

This can be written as a recurrence relation,
:F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}

For this to make sense, at least two starting points need to be given. Here, F_{0} = 0 and F_1 = 1. 

Fibonacci numbers in nature

Fibonacci numbers are related to the ''golden ratio'', which shows up in many places in buildings and in nature.

Binet's Formula
The nth Fibonacci number can be written in terms of the golden ratio. This avoids having to use recursion to calculate Fibonacci numbers, which can take a computer a long time to do.

:F_n = \frac{\varphi^n - (1-\varphi)^n}{\sqrt{5}}

Where \varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}, the golden ratio.
