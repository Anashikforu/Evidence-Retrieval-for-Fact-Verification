 History 
The university is usually said to have been founded in 1222 when a big group of students and professors left the University of Bologna. They did this to look for more academic freedom ('Libertas scholastica'). 
The first subjects to be taught were law and theology. The curriculum got bigger quickly, and by 1399 the institution had divided in two: a ''Universitas Iuristarum'' for Civil law (common law)|civil law and Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law, and a ''Universitas Artistarum'' which taught astronomy, dialectic, philosophy, grammar, medicine, and rhetoric.
