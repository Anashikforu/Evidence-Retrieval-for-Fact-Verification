An '''inflorescence''' is a flowering stem. The term is most used for a group or cluster of flowers arranged on a Plant stem|stem. An inflorescence is the reproductive portion of a plant; each plant bears its flowers in a specific pattern.

Sometimes it is just a close bunch of flowers (e.g. ''lamiales|Antirrhinum'') on a ''spike''. Sometimes the inflorescence is so tight it looks like one single flower. What you see as a single daisy is actually made of several hundred tiny flowers packed together. This kind of inflorescence is called a '''pseudanthium''' ("false flower").

 Advantages 
The advantages of the inflorescence mode is all about reproduction compared to a single primitive flower of the ''Magnolia'' type.Stevens P. F. 2001 onwards. ''Angiosperm Phylogeny website''. 2006 and updated. 
;Numbers: There may be dozens or even hundreds of flowers in an inflorescence, with many seeds or fruits for each flowering.
;Pollination: Increased pollination is an important bonus. Massing flowers together makes them more visible to pollinating insects and birds.
;Seed or fruit dispersal: Dispersal by wind or animals is improved by having the flowers at the top end of a stem.
