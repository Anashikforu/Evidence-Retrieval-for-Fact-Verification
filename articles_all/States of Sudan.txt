 History 
Anglo-Egyptian Sudan had eight ''mudiriyat'', or provinces, which were ambiguous when created but became well defined by the beginning of the Second World War.  The eight provinces were: Blue Nile, Darfur, Equatoria, Kassala (state)|Kassala, Khartoum (state)|Khartoum, Kurdufan, Northern, Sudan|Northern, and Upper Nile, Sudan|Upper Nile.  In 1948 Bahr al Ghazal split from Equatoria. 

There were numerous new provinces created on 1 July 1973.  North Darfur|North and South Darfur were created from Darfur, while Kurdufan divided into North Kurdufan|North and South Kurdufan.  Al Jazirah, Sudan|Al Jazirah and White Nile, Sudan|White Nile were split off from Blue Nile.  River Nile, Sudan|River Nile split off from Northern.  Red Sea, Sudan|Red Sea was split off from Kassala.

A further fracturing of provinces occurred in 1976.  Lakes, Sudan|Lakes split from Bahr al Ghazal, and Jonglei split off from Upper Nile.  Equatoria divided into East Equatoria|East and West Equatoria.  There were thus eighteen provinces.  In 1991, the government reorganized the administrative regions into nine federal states, matching the nine provinces that had existed from 1948 to 1973.  On 14 February 1994, the government reorganized yet again, creating twenty-six ''wilayat'' (states).  The majority of the wilayat were either the old provinces or administrative subregions of a province.  As part of the new government structure in South Sudan in 2005, Bahr al Jabal was renamed Central Equatoria. In 2006, West Kurdufan was split and merged with North Kurdufan and South Kurdufan.
