A '''digital signal processor''' ('''DSP''' or '''DSP micro''') is a specialized microprocessor designed specifically for digital signal processing, generally used in real-time computing.

Digital signal processing algorithms require a large number of Mathematics|mathematical operations to be performed quickly on a set of data.  Signals are converted from Analog-to-digital converter|analog to digital, manipulated digitally, and then converted again to form Digital-to-analog converter|digital to analog, as shown in the diagram.  Many digital signal processing applications have Real-time computing|real-time constraints; that is, for the system to work, the DSP operation must be completed within some time limit.

The microarchitecture of a digital signal processor is optimized specifically for digital signal processing applications.
