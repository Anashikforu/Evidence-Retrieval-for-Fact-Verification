'''World War III''' is the name given to a possible third world war. It refers to a world war that may happen. It would be the successor to World War II (19391945).

A world war might be fought by multiple Country|countries of the world against one other, sometimes across different continents. An all-out war fought between two or three major powers would be a world war.

Because technology and weapons have become so advanced, most people agree that if World War III ever happens, nuclear weapon|nuclear, biological weapon|biological, and chemical weapon|chemical weapons may be used. Biological weapons are living things, usually bacteria or viruses. Chemical weapons might not kill quickly but poison people or their land. Together, nuclear, biological and chemical weapons are called weapons of mass destruction. Conventional weapons, on the other hand are "normal" weapons like guns or non-nuclear bombs.

Mass destruction could damage much of the Earth and kill many humans and other living things. Albert Einstein is often quoted as having said: "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones". Einstein might not have actually said this, but other things that he said show that he believed the weapons used in World War III might be so devastating that they would end civilization as we know it.

 Actual events called World War III 
Some events, for example the Cold War, have been called "World War III." President of the United States|US President George W. Bush compared the War on Terrorism to World War III.

Neither was even remotely like what a world war would be. The Cold War was not fought on a large scale, and the Iraq War was largely conventional and was mostly contained in one general area. Terrorism is indeed a form of conflict, but it is not a world war.
