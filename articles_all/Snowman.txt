A '''snowman''' is a statue of a person made of snow. Snowmen are usually made when people make three Sphere|balls of snow that are different sizes.(In Japan, snowmen are made by two snowballs) They will stack the balls on top of each other to make a snowman, and stick some things in it to make it look more like a person like a scarf, pebbles, buttons and a carrot (for the nose). 

The biggest snowman in the United States|US was built on February 26, 2008, which was 122 feet and 1 inch long.
