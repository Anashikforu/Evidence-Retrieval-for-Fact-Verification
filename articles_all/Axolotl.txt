The '''axolotl''' (''Ambystoma mexicanum'') is the best known of the Mexican mole salamanders: it belongs to the Tiger Salamander complex. The Axolotl shows neoteny: the larvae do not undergo metamorphosis, so the adults stay aquatic, with external gills. 

 Natural history 
The species evolved in the lake underlying Mexico City. Axolotls are used a lot in scientific research because they can Regeneration|regenerate most body parts, are easy to breed, and have large embryos. 

Axolotls are closely related to Tiger Salamander|waterdogs, the larval stage of the closely related Tiger salamanders ''Tiger salamander|Ambystoma tigrinum'' and ''Ambystoma mavortium''. These are common in much of North America and also sometimes become neotenic. The mudpuppy|mudpuppies, ''Necturus'', are fully-aquatic salamanders which are not closely related to the axolotl but bear a superficial resemblance.

Wild axolotls are now near extinction 
 Genetics and development 
Compared with land-dwelling salamanders, the sexually mature adult Axolotl is a wikt:chimera|chimera (~ mixture) of larval and adult Tissue (biological)|tissues. A mutation in hormone production slows the development of the non-sexual tissues compared to the gonads.King R.C. Stansfield W.D. & Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics''. 7th ed, Oxford University Press. p203 So, it ends up as an adult which looks like a larva, except that it is sexually mature. This is an example of neoteny, a type of heterochrony. Axolotls in the lab have reduced pigmentation and end up being a lighter pink color, while axolotls that live in nature are a darker, brown to black color.
