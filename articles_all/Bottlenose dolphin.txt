A '''bottlenose dolphin''' or '''Atlantic bottlenose dolphin''' (''Tursiops truncatus'') is a kind of dolphin. The name "bottlenose" comes from its snout being shaped like a bottle. It breathes through a hole on top of its head. Its brain is very large, and it is one of the most intelligent animals. Bottlenose dolphins are closely related to porpoises. They are skilled and accurate hunters which eat small fish.  

Bottlenose dolphins are grey, with dark grey near their ''blowhole'' (the small hole on the top of their head for breathing). They are light grey on their belly. This is called countershading: it makes them less easy to see. 

When it is grown up, it is about 2 to 4 meters (6.6 to 13.1ft) and about 150 to 650 kilograms (330 1430 pounds). The males are a usually a bit bigger than females. Dolphins which live in warm places are smaller than dolphins that live in cold places.
