A '''data storage device''' is a device for recording (storing) information (data). Recording can be done using virtually any form of energy. People have been storing data for thousands of years, by pictures and writing. Modern storage device may hold information, process information, or both. Most often the term is used with computers. Data storage devices can permanently hold data, like computer file|files.

''Electronic data storage'' is storage which requires electricity to store and get back that data. Most storage devices that do not require Visual perception|visual optics to read data fall into this category.  Electronic data may be stored in either an Analog signal|analog or digital signal format.

Terminology
An organic '''brain''' may or may not be considered a data storage device.Ray Bradbury, ''Fahrenheit 451'', 1950, 1953 pp:150-152, 

All information is data. However, not all data is information.

Data storage equipment
Any input/output equipment may be considered data storage equipment if it writes to and reads from a data storage medium. Data storage equipment uses either:
 '''portable methods''' (easily replaced),
 '''semi-portable''' methods requiring mechanical disassembly tools and/or opening a chassis, or
 '''inseparable methods''' meaning loss of memory if disconnected from the unit.
The following are examples of those methods:

= Portable methods =
arts and crafts|Hand crafting
Flat surface
Printmaking
Photographic
 Fabrication
Textile
 Cylinder (geometry)|Cylindrical accessing
 Memory card reader/drive
 Tape drive
Mono reel or reel-to-reel
Compact Cassette player/recorder
 Disk accessing
Disk drive
Floppy disk
 Cartridge (electronics)|Cartridge accessing/connecting (tape/disk/circuitry)
 Peripheral equipment|Peripheral Networking hardware|networking
 USB flash drive|Flash memory devices

= Semi-portable methods =
 Hard disk drive
 NVRAM|non-volatile RAM

= Inseparable methods =
 volatile memory|Volatile Random access memory|RAM

Recording medium
A recording medium is a physical material that holds data expressed in any of the existing recording formats. With electronic media, the data and the recording medium is sometimes referred to as "software" despite the more common use of the word to describe computer software.

=Ancient and timeless examples=

 Optical
 Any Physical body|object visible to the eye, used to mark a location such as a, Rock (geology)|stone, flag or skull.
 Any arts and crafts|crafting material used to form shapes such as clay, wood, metal, glass, wax.
 Quipu
 Any branding surface that would scar under intense heat (chiefly for livestock branding|livestock or human branding|humans).
 Any marking substance such as paint, ink or chalk.
 Any item that would hold a marking substance such as, papyrus, paper, skin.
 Chemical
 RNA
 DNA
 Pheromone

=Modern examples by energy used=



Chemical

 Holographic versatile disc
 3D optical data storage
Electrical
Semiconductor used in volatile memory|volatile Random access memory|RAM microchips
Floating-gate transistor used in  NVRAM|non-volatile memory cards

=Modern examples by shape=
A typical way to classify data storage media is to consider its shape and type of movement (or non-movement) relative to the read/write device(s) of the storage apparatus as listed:
 Paper card storage
 Punched card (mechanical)
 Tape storage (long, thin, flexible, linearly moving bands)
 Punched tape|Paper tape (mechanical)
 Magnetic tape (a tape passing one or more ''read/write/erase heads'')
 Disk storage (flat, round, rotating object)
 Gramophone record (used for distributing some 1980s home computer programs) (mechanical)
 Floppy disk, Zip drive|ZIP disk (removable) (magnetic)
 HDSS|Holographic
 Optical disc such as Compact disc|CD, DVD, Blu-ray Disc
 Minidisc
 Hard disk drive (magnetic)
 Magnetic bubble memory
 Flash memory/memory card (solid state semiconductor memory)
 xD-Picture Card
 MultiMediaCard
 Universal Serial Bus|USB USB flash drive|flash drive (also known as a "thumb drive" or "keydrive")
 SmartMedia
 CompactFlash I and II
 Secure Digital Card|Secure Digital
 Memory Stick|Sony Memory Stick (Std/Duo/PRO/MagicGate versions)
 Solid-state drive
