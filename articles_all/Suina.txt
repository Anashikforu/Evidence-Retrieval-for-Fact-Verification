The suborder '''Suina''' (also known Suiformes) contains perhaps the earliest and most archaic even-toed ungulates.

This suborden Suina includes family Suidae (pigs, hogs) and the family Tayassuidae (peccary|peccaries). Older morphogical studies also identified family Hippopotamidae (hippopotamus|hippos) among the Suina.
