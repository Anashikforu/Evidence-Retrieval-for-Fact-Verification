A '''browser game''' is a video game that is played on a web browser. It is different from other console game|video and personal computer game|computer games in that it normally does not need any software to be installed on the user's computer, except for the web browser.  There are games that rely solely on client-side technologies such as JavaScript or common plugins such as Java applet|Java or Adobe Flash Player|Flash Player, whereas some employ server-side scripting. The latter case consists typically of (massively multiplayer online game|massive) multiplayer games, whereas the client-side games are typically single-player games. A game played in a browser is often called a '''browser-based game'''.



Post-2010, browser games written in other formats besides Flash remain popular, such as HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly. The most know games are Slither.io, Agar.io, Senpa.io.
