Most music is in a particular '''key'''.  This means that one of the 12 note (music)|notes (C, D flat, D, etc.) sounds like the “home note”.  When the piece finishes it normally comes to rest on this home note (also called: the “tonic”).  The piece will be built on the notes of the Scale (music)|scale that starts on that note. There are two kinds of key (like there are two kinds of scale): major scale|major and minor scale|minor.  Sometimes the key of a piece is in its title: "Minuet in C", "Sonata in F sharp major".  If the title does not say “major” or “minor” it is normally taken to be major.
