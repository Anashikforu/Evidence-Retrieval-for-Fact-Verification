In physics, a '''surface wave''' can refer to a mechanical wave that propagates along the interface between differing media, usually two fluids with different densities.  A surface wave can also be an electromagnetic wave guided by a refractive index gradient.  For radio waves, a '''ground wave''' is a surface wave that propagates close to the surface of the Earth.
