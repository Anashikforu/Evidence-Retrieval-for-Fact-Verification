'''Ralph Metzner''' (May 18, 1936 â€“ March 14, 2019)
In the 1960s, professors Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert collaborated on a book titled ''The Psychedelic :wikt:experience|Experience'', which adapted portions of the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' as a guide for use in lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD experiences. They hoped to give users of LSD a simulation of death and rebirth, to "liberate" them from past problems or mistakes in their lives.
