'''Xenophilius Lovegood''' is a fictional character of the Harry Potter series. He is the father of Luna Lovegood (friend of Harry Potter), and the editor of ''The Quibbler'', a magazine in which he writes the things that just he believes,  such as Nargles and Crumple-Horned Shortsnack. However, during the Second Wizarding War, his magazine published reliable news, to the point that most people switched to it for news. Only when Luna Lovegood|his daughter was kidnapped that the Quibbler started to turn against Harry Potter. Lovegood was played by Rhys Ifans in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''.
