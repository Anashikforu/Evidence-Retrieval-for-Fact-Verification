Reviews of studies on the effects of the Transcendental Meditation technique show some results are not definite while some reviews of studies show patterns of positive effects.John Vogel, Rebecca Costello, and Mitchell Krucoff, Chapter 47 in ''Braunwald's Heart Disease: A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine'', Peter Libbie, et al, eds, Saunders Elsevier, 2007, p. 1157. Quotation: "TM has been shown not only to improve blood pressure but also the insulin resistance components of the metabolic syndrome and cardiac autonomic nervous system tone."

(Jan 1978, Huntsville, Canada)

In 1955,  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (born Mahesh Prasad Varma) began teaching a meditation technique he says was based on the Vedas. He gave this method for meditation the name, Transcendental Meditation.Coplin, J.R. (1990)''Text and Context in the Communication of a Social Movement's Charisma, Ideology, and Consciousness: TM for India and the West''. University of California, San Diego, p. 64

Before this, Maharishi had studied with his teacher Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, and was also his secretary from 1941 until Brahmananda Saraswati's death in 1953. In 1957, Maharishi began the Spiritual Regeneration Movement in Madras, India, on the last day of a festival held in memory of his teacher. In 1958, he began the first of a number of worldwide tours in which he began to teach the TM technique to people around the world.

In the early 1970s, Maharishi  began to establish one Transcendental Meditation teaching center for each million of the people in the world, which at that time would have meant 3,600 Transcendental Meditation centers throughout the world.  In 1990, Maharishi moved to the town of Vlodrop,  in the Netherlands, where he began an organization he called The Global Country of World Peace that takes care of all of the teaching of the Transcendental Meditation technique around the world.  The Global Country of World Peace says there are more than 6 million people worldwide who have learned the Transcendental Meditation technique.

Effects on the Body

Transcendental Meditation has been researched  since 1970. The earliest study, done in 1970, showed that with the Transcendental Meditation technique the body  rests deeply,  but is not asleep, and is alert.Wallace RK. ''Physiological effects of Transcendental Meditation''. Science 1970;167:1751â€“1754Wallace RK. The Physiology of Meditation. Scientific American 1972;226:84-90Wallace RK, Benson H, Wilson AF. ''A wakeful hypometabolic physiologic state''. American Journal of Physiology 1971;221:795-799  This study also showed that with the Transcendental Meditation technique stress became less.

According to one study Transcendental Meditation has been found to not have any advantages over health education in improving a persons health.

Transcendental Meditation websites say the Transcendental Meditation technique does not interfere with a person's religion.
