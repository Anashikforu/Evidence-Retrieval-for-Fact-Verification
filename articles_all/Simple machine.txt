A '''simple machine''' is a device that can change the direction or the Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude of a Force (physics)|force, or the point where it is applied. This is done so that the force can be used to do work.  All mechanics|mechanical machines are made by combining simple machines.

There are six basic "simple machines", as defined by Renaissance scientists:  
#The lever (also called a rope or staff) can move the point at which a force is applied and may also change the magnitude and direction of the force.
#The wheel change the direction in which the force is applied. 
#The pulley changes the point where a force is applied, and may also change its magnitude and direction.
#The inclined plane
#The wedge (mechanics)|wedge
#The screw that converts rotational motion to linear motion, and a rotational force to a linear force.

The use of simple machines can be traced back to ''homo habilis'' (the first humans to use tools), but certain animals other than man also use them. 

A ''compound machine'' is made up of two or more simple machines.
