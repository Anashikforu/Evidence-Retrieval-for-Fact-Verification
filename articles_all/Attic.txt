The '''attic''' is the highest part of a house, it is directly below the roof. It is sometimes used as storage. Some people have "loft conversions" (change the attic into a room people can use) so that they can sleep in it. Attics can be hard to reach, which is why many of them are not used. They can help keep the temperature of the house stable.

Origin
The word "attic" derived from the Attica region in Greece. It comes from the Attic style architecture.
