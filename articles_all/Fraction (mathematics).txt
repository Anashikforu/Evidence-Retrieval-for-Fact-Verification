A '''fraction''' is a number that shows how many equal parts there are. When we write fractions, we show one number with a line above (or a slash next to) another number.

The top part of the fraction is called a numerator. The bottom part of the fraction is called a denominator. For example, for the fraction \tfrac{1}{4}, the 1 is the numerator, and the 4 is the denominator.


Examples of fraction
#A room where \tfrac{1}{4} of the people are girls, has 1 girl for every 4 people.
#A cake can be thought of as being made up of 4 equal parts, where each is 1 part of 4. This can be written as \tfrac{1}{4}, and is called a "quarter". Similarly, 2 parts of the cake (2 quarters) can be written \tfrac{2}{4}, which is also equal to 1/2 (one-half).

 Mathematical fractions 
A fraction is a mathematics|mathematical expression relating two quantities or numbers, where one Division (mathematics)|divides the other. When the two quantities are whole numbers (or integers), this is called a rational number (such as the fraction \tfrac{1}{2}). When the two quantities are polynomials, this is called a rational function.




Mathematically, a fraction is a quotient of numbers, representing the number's value when the numerator (upper number) is divided by the denominator (lower number). Thus \tfrac{1}{2} means one divided by two, or, in decimals, 0.5.

To find \tfrac{1}{2} of \tfrac{1}{2}, the denominators are multiplied, and because denominator 2 multiplied by 2 equals 4, we have that \tfrac{1}{2} x \tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{1}{4}, or 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25.

(In this case, “\tfrac{1}{2} of” means "multiplication".)

To find \tfrac{1}{2} ''divided by'' \tfrac{1}{2}, multiply \tfrac{1}{2} by the reciprocal of \tfrac{1}{2}, which is 2. That answer is 1.

 Multiplying 
To multiply two fractions, the first numerator is Multiplication|multiplied by the other numerator, and the first denominator is multiplied by the other denominator. For example. '''''' after the simplication.
