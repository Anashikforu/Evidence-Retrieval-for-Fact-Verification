= Origin of chordates =
According to a long-standing theory, the origin of chordates may be found in transformed larvae of sea-squirts (tunicates). Adult tunicates are Sessility (zoology)|sessile, but their larvae are motile, and have some features found in early vertebrates.  The process of paedomorphosis, where juvenile features are retained in the adult, is the proposed mechanism.Garstang, Walter 1894. Preliminary notes on a new theory of the phylogeny of the chordates.
