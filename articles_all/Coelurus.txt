'''''Coelurus''''' (meaning "hollow") is a poorly known genus. It was perhaps a bipedal theropod dinosaur 6&nbsp;feet (1.8&nbsp;m) long, weighing roughly 20&nbsp;kg. Its femur (thigh bone) was 55&nbsp;cm long. It was a carnivore that lived during the late Jurassic|Jurassic period, about 156 to 145 million years ago. Its bones were hollow and lightweight, so ''Coelurus'' was probably light and fast. Its fossils were found in Wyoming. ''Coelurus'' was named by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh|Othniel C. Marsh in 1879.
