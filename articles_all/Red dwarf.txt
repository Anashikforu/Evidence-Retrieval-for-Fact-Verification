A '''red dwarf''' is a kind of star. Red dwarf stars are smaller than wikt:half|half the size of the Sun. They are also wikt:cool|cooler than most stars. Red dwarfs burn their fuel slowly, so they shine with less light than heat|hot stars.

Red dwarf stars are the most common in our galaxy, at least near our sun.We cannot see them if they are in distant galaxies. However, since red dwarf stars are cool and small, none can be found with the naked eye. The closest star to the Earth is named Proxima Centauri. The Latin language|Latin word ''proxima'' means "nearest to". Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf. 

 Life and death 
Red dwarfs can live 1000000000000 (number)|trillions of years, much longer than brighter stars. A red dwarf dies when it burns all of its fuel. To start with, the fuel is the chemical element hydrogen. At present, no red dwarf star is known which has gone beyond this stage.

Red dwarfs are small stars that are around 0.2 solar mass (the sun is equal to 1 solar mass). This is small for a star but is still 60,000 times the mass of the Earth. They are formed in nebulas, as all stars are, and originally they were protostars. They start their nuclear fusion about 100,000 years after being formed. This gives them their red glow. These stars burn at less than 4,000Â°Kelvin|K.

Even smaller stars are called brown dwarfs.
