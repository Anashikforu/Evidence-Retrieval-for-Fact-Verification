'''Parallel computing''' is a form of computing|computation in which many Instruction (computer science)|instructions are carried out simultaneously (termed "in parallel"),Almasi, G.S. and A. Gottlieb (1989). 
There are several different forms of parallel computing: 
#Bit-level parallelism,
#Instruction level parallelism|Instruction-level parallelism,
#Data parallelism, 
#Task parallelism.

It has been used for many years, mainly in high performance computing|high-performance computing, with a great increase in its use in recent years, due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. Parallel computing has become the main model in computer architecture, mainly in the form of Multi-core processors.Asanovic, Krste et al. (December 18, 2006). 
Parallel computers can be classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelismâ€”with Multi-core processor|multi-core and Symmetric multiprocessing|multi-processor computers having multiple Central processing unit|processing elements inside a single machine, while Computer cluster|clusters, Blade server|blades, Massive parallel processing|MPPs, and Grid computing|grids use multiple computers to work on the same task.

Parallel algorithm|Parallel computer programs are more difficult to Computer program|program than sequential ones,David A. Patterson (scientist)|Patterson, David A. and John L. Hennessy (1998). ''Computer Organization and Design'', Second Edition, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, p.&nbsp;715. . because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs, of which race conditions and Deadlock|dead locks are the most common. however many Parallel programming model|parallel programming languages have been created to simplify parallel computers programming. But still Computer networking|communication and Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization between the different subtasks is difficult while achieving good parallel program performance.
