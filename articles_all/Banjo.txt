The '''banjo''' is a string instrument, that was first played by African slaves in the United States  a few hundred years ago. The idea came from other African instruments.The name ''banjo'' may have come from a Kimbundu word: ''mbanza'', but it could have also come from a Senegambian word for the bamboo stick used for the banjo's neck.
