A '''command economy''' is where the big decisions are made and owned at the centre by the government.  A '''planned economy''' is where the big decisions are made at the centre by the government. Gregory Grossman 1987. Command economy. In ''The New Palgrave: a dictionary of economics'', v. 1, pp. 494â€“95.

In an economics|economic system the main decisions are, for example, allocating resources like Labour (economics)|labour, capital (economics)|capital and oil. Prices, too, are controlled. In a command economy, these decisions are taken by a central body, usually the government. This system contrasts that of a market economy where all the economic actors involved make decisions. The benefit of a planned economy is that the planning body has (supposedly) perfect information, and can make a better decision than in the market economy. Countries at war sometimes command their people to make things the war needs; the major powers in World War II did this.

Friedrich Hayek|Friedrick von Hayek, a 20th-century economist, thought that it is not possible for the planning body to have perfect information.Hayek, Friedrick 1944. ''The road to serfdom''. 

Planned economies contrast with unplanned economies, specifically market economies, where autonomous firms operating in Market (economics)|markets make decisions about production, distribution, pricing and investment. Market economies that use indicative planning are variously referred to as planned market economies, mixed economies and mixed market economies. A command economy follows an administrative-command system and uses Soviet-type economic planning which was characteristic of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc before most of these countries converted to market economies. This highlights the central role of hierarchical administration and public ownership of production in guiding the allocation of resources in these economic systems.
