'''''Eats, Shoots & Leaves''''' is a book written by Lynne Truss.Truss, Lynne 2003. ''Eats, Shoots & Leaves''. London: Profile.  It explains  how careful writing and punctuation helps writers communicate clearly. One example is the difference between the statements "eats, shoots and leaves" and "eats shoots and leaves." It explains by the example of a panda who walks into a restaurant, eats, draws a gun and shoots at the other wikt:patron|patrons, and then leaves, blaming the incident on the instruction of a badly wikt:punctuated|punctuated wildlife manual. The purpose of the book is to explain the importance of proper punctuation.

The book was interesting to read and a great commercial success  it was a best-seller. However, it had its own punctuation errors and inconsistencies, as a review in the New Yorker magazine pointed out.Menand, Louis 2004. Bad comma: Lynne Truss's strange grammar.''The New Yorker''.
