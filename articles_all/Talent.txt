A '''talent''' (or ''gift'', or ''aptitude'') is the skill that someone has to do something very well(above average performance) that people usually like and that is difficult. Someone who has talent is called ''talented''. Talented people may have more than one talent. Talent is sometimes learned, but in some cases is natural born. People often value talents that are entertaining, beautiful, or impressive for a different reason like Music, dancing, acting or sports.

Even if someone has talent they may still have to work very hard if they want to hone it well. Some people become quite good at something even if they do not have much talent, but only if they are willing to work very hard at the skill for a period of time.

The word ''talent'' used to mean a weight and a coin|piece of money in Assyria, Greece and Rome. This is the sense in which it is used in the Bible in the Parables of Jesus|parable of the five talents (Gospel of Matthew|Matthew, xxv, 14-30).
