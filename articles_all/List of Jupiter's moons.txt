There are 79 known '''moons of Jupiter'''. 

The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius. They were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. The Galilean moons are by far the largest and most massive objects to orbit Jupiter. The other 75 known moons and Rings of Jupiter|the rings together make up just 0.003% of the total orbiting mass. The four are Io (moon)|Io, Europa (moon)|Europa, Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede and Callisto (moon)|Callisto. They are roughly the same size as The Moon|Earth's moon, some are a bit bigger, some are smaller.

From the end of the 19th century, dozens of much smaller Jovian moons have been discovered. All these are less than . Their Orbit|orbital shapes range from nearly perfectly circular to highly Orbital eccentricity|eccentric and inclination|inclined. Many revolve in the direction ''opposite to Jupiter's spin'' (retrograde motion). Orbital periods range from seven hours (taking less time than Jupiter does to spin around its axis), to some three thousand times more (almost three Earth years). 

 List of moons 
This list starts with those that go around Jupiter (orbit) the fastest.  That is, they have the shortest orbital period. Moons highlighted in purple are the "Galilean moons," moons highlighted in dark gray have a retrograde orbit, and moons with the regular white background have a prograde orbit.
