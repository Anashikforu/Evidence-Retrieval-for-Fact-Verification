'''People's Republic''' (sometimes called '''Popular Republic''') is a name for a communist, usually Marxist-Leninist country. Currently, the People's Republic of China (PRC) is the only Marxist-Leninist state in the world that uses the title "People's Republic". Because of this, "People's Republic" is sometimes used to refer to China.
The term is also found in the official name of North Korea - Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
