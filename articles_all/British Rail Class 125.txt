The '''Class 125''' was a design of three car Diesel Multiple Unit built for British Rail in 1958. They were high-density units, externally very similar to the British Rail Class 116|Class 116. They were built specifically for the Lea Valley Line, were all withdrawn in 1977, and none survive to this day. Like many first-generation DMU classes, they never carried their 125xxx TOPS set numbers.
