History
After forming Culpeper County, Virginia, in 1748, the Virginia House of Burgesses voted to establish the Town of Fairfax on February 22, 1759. The name honored Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. He was the proprietor of the Northern Neck, a vast domain north of the Rappahannock River. His territory was then defined as stretching from Chesapeake Bay to what is now Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County, West Virginia.

The original plan of the town called for ten wikt:block|blocks, which form the core of Culpeper's downtown area today. The original town was surveyed by a young George Washington.  In 1795, the town received a post office under the name "Culpeper Court House" Most maps of the time, however, continued to show the Fairfax name. The confusion resulting from the difference in official and postal names was finally resolved when the Virginia Assembly formally renamed the town Culpeper in 1869 (Acts, 1869–1870, chapter 118, page 154).

During the American Revolutionary War, the Culpeper Minutemen, a pro-independence militia, formed in the town of Culpeper. They organized in what was then known as "Clayton's Old Field," near today's Yowell Meadow Park.

During the American Civil War|Civil War, Culpeper was a crossroads for a number of armies marching through central Virginia, with both Union Army|Union and Confederate States of America|Confederate forces occupying the town by turn.
