'''Ecumenism''' (or '''Oecumenism''') is the idea that the different Christian denominations should work together more than they currently do. This idea is different from religious toleration. Over the years, Christianity has been split into many different movements. These separations are based on doctrine, on history, and what people do in everyday life. 

The term '''ecumenical''' comes from the Latin ''oecumenicus'', a phrase referring to "the whole world", meaning literally "inhabited" (lived in).
