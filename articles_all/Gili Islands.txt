The '''Gili Islands''' (Indonesian language|Indonesian:'''Tiga Gili''' Three Gilis, '''Kepulauan Gili''' Gili Islands) are a group of three small islands (or archipelago) – Gili Trawangan, Gili Meno and Gili Air — very close to the northwest coast of Lombok, Indonesia.

The islands are a popular destination for Western tourists.  Each island has several small resorts, usually consisting of a small collection of huts for tourists, and a restaurant.  Most local inhabitants live in the hilly interior of the islands.  Automobiles and motorized traffic are not allowed on the islands by local law. Bicycles or the horse-drawn carriages called a ''cidomo'' are common transportation on the islands. Scuba diving in and around the Gilis is also popular. The name ''Gili'' simply means "small island" in the local Sasak language.
