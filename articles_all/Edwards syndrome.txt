'''Trisomy 18''', also known as '''Edwards syndrome''' is a trisomy. It is a genetic disorder. People with trisomy 18 have three copies of chromosome 18. "Normal" people have two copies of the chromosome. It is named after John H. Edwards, who first described the syndrome in 1960. It is the second most common autosome|autosomal trisomy, after Down Syndrome, that carries to term.  

It is estimated that about  one in 3,000 live births are affected.(2007, July 07). MedlinePlus medical encyclopedia: Trisomy 18. Retrieved November 7, 2008, from MedlinePlus medical encyclopedia Web site: 
About 95% of the babies with Edwards syndrome die before they are born. About half of all babies born with the condition will reach two months of age, and only 5-10% will survive for a year.  The median life span is five to fifteen days.
