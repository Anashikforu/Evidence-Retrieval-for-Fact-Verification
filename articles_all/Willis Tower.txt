 History 
= Planning and construction =
In 1969, Sears|Sears, Roebuck & Co. was the largest retailer in the world, with about 350,000 employees. 

Sears needed  of office space for its planned tower。They hired architects Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM).

With the floors left over Sears decided to rent them to other companies for offices. floors in the lower part of the building. They also added metal floors with many Setback (architecture)|setbacks, which would give the tower its well known look.

The tower passed the height of New York's unfinished World Trade Center to become the world's tallest building.

Black bands appear on the tower around the 29th–32nd, 64th–65th, 88th–89th, and 104th–108th floors.

In February 1982, two television antennas were added to the building, increasing its total height to  on June 5, 2000. It was done to improve reception of local NBC station WMAQ-TV.

=Legal action=
As the construction of the building reached as the 50th floor in 1972, people sued Sears and wanted to stop the building from passing 67 floors.

The Illinois Citizens' Committee for Broadcasting wanted the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to stop the building from getting taller. On May 26, 1972, the Commission did not take action as they did not have the power to do anything. On June 30, 1972, the Illinois Supreme Court supported their decision. On September 8, 1972, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit supported the FCC decision, ending the lawsuit.

=After opening=
The tower did not have as many companies buying office spaces and it was half-empty for many years. In the 2000s, many companies in the tower began to leave because of terrorist threats or because they found better office spaces.

In 1984, Sears decided to improve the appearance of the lower floors for civilians and tourists. Sears talked about the loan again in 1994. This led to an agreement where Sears would no longer be responsible for the $850&nbsp;million loan, although it would only own the name of the building. As part of the 1994 agreement, AEW and Metlife would own the building in 2003.

In 1990, the law firm of Keck, Mahin & Cate wanted to move away from the tower and into 77 West Wacker Drive.

However, in 1997, the Canadian company TrizecHahn bought AEW's holdings of the building for $110&nbsp;million.

In 2004, MetLife sold the building to a group of investors from New York City and Skokie, Illinois.

In June 2006, Liberty City Seven|seven men were arrested by the FBI and charged with plans to destroy the tower.

Since 2007, the owners had thought about building a hotel on the north side of the building. The second building was thought about in the original design. The plan was eventually cancelled as the city did not allow the construction of a tall building in that location.

In February 2009, the owners announced they were thinking about painting the building silver, an idea that was later stopped. It was hoped that a new paint-job would "rebrand" the building and show its energy efficiency for a cost of $50&nbsp;million.

In 2015, the Blackstone Group bought the tower for a reported $1.3&nbsp;billion, the highest price ever paid for a U.S. property outside of New York City.

In May 2020, after many days of raining, the building's three basement levels were flooded. This caused the power to go out and many television and radio stations going off the air.

=Naming rights=

Sears' naming rights ended in 2003, but the building was still called the Sears Tower for many years. In March 2009, the British insurance company Willis Group Holdings agreed to rent a part of the building and got the naming rights. On August 13, 2012, United Airlines said they were moving its corporate headquarters from 77 West Wacker Drive to Willis Tower.

The naming rights are legally kept for 15 years, making it is possible that the building's name change again as soon as 2024.

=Climbing=
On May 25, 1981, Dan Goodwin climbed the tower while using suction cups and wearing a Spider-Man costume. The Chicago Fire Department tried to stop him, but he made the first successful outside climb of the tower.

In August 1999, Alain Robert|Alain "Spiderman" Robert climbed the building all the way to the top using only his hands and feet. He climbed at the last 20 storey|stories of the building.

Since 2009, the Willis Tower has hosted SkyRise Chicago, the world's tallest indoor stair climb as a charity event. At the event, people can legally walk up the building's 103-story staircase.
