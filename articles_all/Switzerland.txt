 History 
In 1291, people from Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden wanted to be free. They signed a contract to work together called the ''Eternal Alliance''. Together, they could be free from the people of Habsburg, who were very strong. In 1315 the people from the Eternal Alliance fought the Habsburgs in battles at Morgarten, Sempach and Näfels. The people of the Eternal Alliance won all the battles.

People from other areas signed the contract and joined the Eternal Alliance. More and more people worked together to be free. In 1648, other countries from Europe made an agreement that Switzerland was free. The name of this agreement was the ''Peace of Westphalia''. More areas came to be part of Switzerland.

Switzerland was important to the slave trade that forced Black people|black Africa|Africans to be sold as slaves. Swiss companies made indiennes, which are a kind of cloth. These cloths were sent to Africa and exchanged for captured slaves. Some Swiss also joined French companies already making indiennes or owned plantations with slaves in French colonies.

In 1798, France invaded Switzerland.  The ruler of France was Napoleon.  He changed many laws.  In 1815 Switzerland again became independent from France.  Other countries agreed at the Congress of Vienna that Switzerland was free and neutral. 

The constitution of Switzerland that was made after a short civil war in 1848 was replaced in 1999. Switzerland did not fight in World War I or World War II. Since 2002, Switzerland is part of the United Nations.  It did not join the United Nations for 57 years because of its neutrality.

 Government 


Switzerland is a republic. Switzerland does not have the same kind of president as the United States or France. Seven people (called ministers) do the job of president. They are called the Federal Council in English, ''Bundesrat'' in German, ''Conseil Fédéral'' in French, ''Consiglio Federale'' in Italian and ''Cussegl Federal'' in Romansh. Every year one of these people is made president. The president is not more important than the other six people. At present 3 of the 7 people are women.

The seven people are:
 Simonetta Sommaruga 
 Guy Parmelin 
 Ueli Maurer
 Alain Berset (Vicepresident 2022)
 Ignazio Cassis (President 2022)
 Viola Amherd
 Karin Keller-Sutter

There are two parts of parliament in Switzerland. The ''Council of States'' and the ''National Council''. Only both together can make laws. There are 46 people in the Council of States. Every full canton of Switzerland can send 2 people. There are 200 people in the National Council. The biggest canton sends most people to the National Council. The smallest 6 cantons can only send one person to the National Council.

The people of Switzerland can collect signatures if they do not like a new law or a law change. This is called a ''referendum''. If enough people sign a referendum, the people vote. The people can also collect signatures to change the constitution. This is called an ''initiative''. The constitution is the basic law of a country. 

 Economy 
Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, but it is member of the European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA). The EFTA makes trade with other countries in Europe easier. In 1999 Switzerland and the European Union made a contract. This contract makes trade even easier. They recently made two other contracts.
