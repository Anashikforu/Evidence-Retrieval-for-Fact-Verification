'''Inclusive education''' is an idea in the field of education. It means that persons with disability|disabilities or persons who need special care can learn in schools together with people who do not have special education|special needs. This idea comes from the idea of social justice. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also says that access to education is a human right.

Whether the education takes place in schools with all kinds of pupils is a matter of practicality. There is no general rule which can always be followed. Some kinds of disability needs both specially trained teachers, and a separate environment from the normal classrooms.
