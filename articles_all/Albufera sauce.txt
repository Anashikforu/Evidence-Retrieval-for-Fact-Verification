'''Albufera sauce''' (known in French as '''''Sauce Albuféra''''') is a minor sauce whose  mother sauce is velouté. It was probably created by Antonin Careme, to accompany Poularde Albufera, which he also created. It was named in honour of the Louis Gabriel Suchet|Duke of Albufera. 

Escoffier gives a recipe in ''Le Guide culinaire'' which consists of a base of  Suprême Sauce to which is added meat glaze in order to lend the latter an ivory-white tint which characterizes it. It is served chiefly with poultry and  sweetbreads.Auguste Escoffier (1907), ''Le Guide culinaire''
