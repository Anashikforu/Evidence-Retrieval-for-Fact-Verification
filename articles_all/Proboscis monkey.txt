The '''proboscis monkey''' (''Nasalis larvatus'') is found only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. 

They live in mangrove forests, and also lowland rainforests. It depends on the mangroves near river edges for resting and sleeping. They avoid deforested areas and avoid human settlements.

The proboscis monkey eats mainly fruit and leaves.Boonratana R. 1993. ''The ecology and behaviour of the proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus) in the lower Kinabatangan, Sabah''. PhD dissertation, Mahidol University. It also eats flowers, seeds and insects to a lesser extent.  At least 55 different plant species are eaten. Young leaves are preferred over mature leaves and unripe fruits are preferred over ripe fruit. Being a seasonal eater, the proboscis monkey eats mostly fruit from January to May and mostly leaves from June to December.
