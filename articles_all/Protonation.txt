'''Protonation''' is the addition of a hydrogen ion to a substance. A hydrogen atom normally contains 1 proton and 1 electron. When the hydrogen atom is oxidation|oxidized, it loses its electron, leaving a H+. The H+ is the same as a proton. Substances are protonated when hydrogen ions are added to them. For example, when ammonia (NH3) is protonated, it forms ammonium ions, NH4+. A substance is protonated by a substance more acid|acidic than it. The acidic substance is deprotonation|deprotonated.
