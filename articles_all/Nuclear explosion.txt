Atmospheric nuclear explosions are associated with ''mushroom clouds'', although mushroom clouds can occur as a result of large chemical explosions. It is also possible to have an air-burst nuclear explosion without these clouds. Nuclear explosions produce radiation and radioactive debris.

The nuclear weapon was first detonated in combat on 6 August 1945, when the United States dropped a uranium gun-type device on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. The second and last use of a nuclear weapon in combat occurred three days later when United States dropped a plutonium implosion-type device on the Japanese city of Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki. These atomic bomb|bombings resulted in the immediate deaths of around 120,000 people while more died over time due the nuclear radiation. 

Power plant accidents such as those at Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear disaster|Fukushima were caused by steam and hydrogen explosions, not nuclear explosions. The fuel in a nuclear power plant is not Enriched uranium|enriched enough to create a nuclear explosion.
