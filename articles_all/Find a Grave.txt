It was started by Jim Tipton,

 Content and features 
The site's FAQ says they hope to list all the burial places of everyone in the world.

The website has lists of cemeteries and graves from all around the world. The American cemeteries are organized by state and county, and many records contain Google Maps and photographs of the cemeteries. Each grave record can contain: dates and places of birth and death, information about the person, cemetery and plot information, photographs (grave marker, the person, etc.), and information about who added it to Find A Grave.

Members can place on-line memorials for family and friends for no cost. Users can edit the memorials. Members may also request photos of graves which Find A Grave volunteers can add.
