'''Democratic socialism''' is a socialism where government is organized by democracy. In short, it believes that social and economic decisions should be made by those whom they most affect. 

The combination of the two ideologies of democracy and socialism make democratic socialism. Democratic socialists believe that both the economy and society should be run democratically—to meet public needs, not to make profits for a few. To achieve a more just society, many structures of the government and economy must be radically transformed through greater economic and social democracy so that ordinary citizens can participate in the many decisions that affect their lives. Democratic socialists do not want to create an all-powerful government bureaucracy, but at the same time do not want big corporate bureaucracies to control our society either.  

Examples of democratic socialist include Salvador Allende, the democratically elected President of Chile who was overthrown by a US-backed Coup d'état|coup de etat; Evo Morales, the former president of Bolivia; and the United Kingdom Parliament's former Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn.

Democratic socialism is not the same as Marxism-Leninism, which believes in single party rule.
