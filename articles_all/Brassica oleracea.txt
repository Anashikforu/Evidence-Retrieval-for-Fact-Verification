'''''Brassica oleracea''''', or '''wild cabbage''', is a species of ''Brassica'' native to coastal southern and western Europe.

Its tolerance of sodium chloride|salt and calcium carbonate|lime, and its dislike of competition from other plants, restrict it to limestone sea cliffs, like the chalk cliffs on both sides of the English Channel. 

 Cultivation 
''B. oleracea'' is believed to have been cultivated for several thousand years. It has been bred into a wide range of cultivars, including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and more. Some of which are hardly recognisable as being members of the same genus, let alone species.

Some (notably brussels sprouts and broccoli) contain high levels of sinigrin which may help prevent bowel cancer.
