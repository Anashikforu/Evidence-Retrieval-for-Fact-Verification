'''Human biology''' is an area of study that is part of biology, biological anthropology, and medicine which looks at humans; it is closely related to primate biology, and a number of other areas.

Human biology research includes:
 Genetics|Genetic differences across human populations, present and past
 Biological differences related to climate and other elements of the natural environment
 Finding the risk of degenerative disease and infectious disease for different populations of people
 Human growth and development

There are not exact boundaries between human biology and regular medical research. However, human biology usually focuses more on health for an entire group of people, and on human evolution, adaptation, and population genetics rather than individual health.
