A '''chemical compound''' is a chemical formed from atoms of different chemical elements. The different atoms are joined by chemical bonds. Each compound has a fixed ratio between the elements (crystal)

The elements stick together so strongly that the compound behaves like one substance. The chemical that is made depends upon what atoms it is made of and how they are joined together.

Chemical compounds can be liquids, like water which is made from atoms of hydrogen and oxygen joining together. They can also be solids, like sodium chloride that contains sodium and chlorine atoms. We get compounds from natural sources such as plants or make them in laboratory|laboratories. Compounds can be made from others by scientists and these are called ''synthetic chemicals''.

When different compounds are mixed together they may have a chemical reaction. 
Some chemical compounds can be dangerous but are safe if they are used the right way. Most dangerous chemicals are only used by scientists who have had special training in how to handle and use them. These chemicals might be poisonous, corrosive, explosive, they may catch fire easily, or they may chemical reaction|react with other substances.

People who work in factory|factories near chemicals often wear special clothes that stop the chemicals from hurting their body.
