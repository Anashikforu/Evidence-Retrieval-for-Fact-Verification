Image:Form of government parliamentary.png|right|350px|thumb|States with parliamentary systems are in '''red''' (constitutional monarchies with a parliament)  and '''orange'''  (parliamentary republics with a non-royal head of state). States in '''green''' have the head of state and head of government in one office, filled by parliament's choice and elected separately

A '''parliamentary system''' of government means that the Executive (government)|executive branch of government has the direct or indirect support of the parliament. This support is usually shown by a vote of confidence.  A balanced relationship between the executive and the legislature in a parliamentary system is called responsible government.

The separation of powers between the Executive (government)|executive and Legislature|law making branches is not as obvious as it is in a presidential system. There are different ways of balancing power between the three branches which govern the country (the executive (or ministers), the law makers and the judges).

Parliamentary systems usually have a  ''head of government'' and a ''head of state''. They change after their terms are over.  The head of government is the prime minister, who has the real power.  The head of state may be an elected president or, in the case of a constitutional monarchy, hereditary.

Examples of a few countries which practice parliamentary systems are India, Italy, Japan, and Latvia to name a few. Parliament is different in every country.
