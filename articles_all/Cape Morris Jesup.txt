'''Cape Morris Jesup''' is the northernmost point of mainland Greenland.

In 1892 when Robert Peary reached the cape he said that it was the northernmost point of land. Later it was discovered that Kaffeklubben Island was slightly north of Cape Morris Jesup. Cape Morris Jesup was named after Morris Ketchum Jesup, an American philanthropist.
