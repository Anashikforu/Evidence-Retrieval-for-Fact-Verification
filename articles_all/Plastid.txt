A '''plastid''' is a self-reproducing organelle of plants and algae. A '''plastome''' is the DNA genome of a plastid.King R.C. Stansfield W.D. & Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics'', 7th ed. Oxford.p341 They are like tiny machines inside cells: each makes or stores important chemicals used by the plant. 

Examples of plastids are: 
 Chloroplasts: photosynthesis; other plastids may have developed from chloroplasts. Etioplasts are chloroplasts which have not been exposed to light.
 Chromoplasts: pigment synthesis and storage. 
 Leucoplasts: colourless, make terpenes such as resin. Sometimes they develop into more specialized types of plastid:
 Amyloplasts: starch storage
 Elaioplasts: fat storage.
 Proteinoplasts: store & modify protein.
 Statoliths: detect gravity.

Plastids in algae
Plastids in algae and hornworts  may differ from plant plastids. In algae, the term "leucoplast" is used for all unpigmented plastids and their function differs from the leucoplasts of plants. 

Glaucocystophyte|Glaucocystophytic algae contain muroplasts, which are similar to chloroplasts except that they have a cell wall, similar to that of prokaryotes. Rhodophyte|Rhodophytic algae contain rhodoplasts, which are red chloroplasts which allow the algae to photosynthesise to a depth of up to 268 metres.Wise, Robert R. 2006.

 Genetics and evolution 
Plastids are one of the many different types of organelles in the cell. In endosymbiont theory, plastids originated as cyanobacteria. This was first suggested by Mereschkowsky in 1905. 

Almost all chloroplasts are thought to derive directly or indirectly from a single Endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic event.
