McGahee was drafted by the Buffalo Bills with the 23rd pick in the 2003 NFL Draft. McGahee did not play at all in his first season.

However, McGahee passed 1,000 yards the next two seasons and scored 13 total times in 2004. In 2006, McGahee's rushing total dropped to 990 yards on 259 carries, plus six touchdowns. He wore #21.

In 2008, McGahee struggled with injuries. His statistics dropped to 170 attempts, 671 yards, and 7 scores, including a 77 yard touchdown to help win a game against the Dallas Cowboys. He was carted off the field after colliding (hitting into) Pittsburgh Steelers safety Ryan Clark in an AFC Championship loss.
