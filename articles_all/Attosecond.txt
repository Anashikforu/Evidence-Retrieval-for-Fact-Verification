An '''attosecond''' ('''as''') is a very short period of time.Website of the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) 
Here is a list of time spans shorter than 1 attosecond:
 10&minus;21 seconds = 1 ''zeptosecond''
 10&minus;24 seconds = 1 ''yoctosecond''
 10&minus;27 seconds = 1 ''xonosecond''
 10&minus;30 seconds = 1 ''vecosecond''
 10&minus;33 seconds = 1 ''mecosecond''
 10&minus;36 seconds = 1 ''duecosecond''
 10&minus;39 seconds = 1 ''trecosecond''
 10&minus;42 seconds = 1 ''tetrecosecond''
 10&minus;45 seconds = 1 ''pentecosecond''
 10&minus;48 seconds = 1 ''hexecosecond''
 10&minus;51 seconds = 1 ''heptecosecond''
 10&minus;54 seconds = 1 ''octecosecond''
 10&minus;57 seconds = 1 ''ennecosecond''
 10&minus;60 seconds = 1 ''icososecond''

 1 attosecond: It takes 1 attosecond for light to travel the length of three hydrogen|hydrogen atoms.
 1 attosecond: It takes 1 attosecond for an atomic nucleus to react when another particle hits it.
 150 attoseconds: It takes 150 attoseconds for an electron to circle the nucleus of an atom.
 320 attoseconds: It takes about 300 attoseconds for an electron to jump from one atom to another.
