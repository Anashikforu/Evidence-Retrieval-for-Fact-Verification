'''Kinetic energy''' is the energy that an object has because of its Movement|motion. This energy can be converted into other kinds, such as gravitational or electric potential energy, which is the energy that an object has because of its position in a gravitational or electric field.

 Difference between Kinetic & Potential Energy 
Kinetic Energy is the maximum amount of work a moving body due to its motion can do, whereas Potential energy is the maximum amount of work a body can do due to its configuration or position in a field force.  Kinetic Energy is valid for all sorts of forces as seen from this derivation.
: \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{x} = \frac{d \mathbf{p}}{dt} \cdot d \mathbf{x} = \frac{d \mathbf{p}}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{v}dt = \mathbf{v} \cdot \frac{d \mathbf{p}}{dt} dt = \mathbf{v} \cdot d \mathbf{p} 

but Potential Energy is not as can be seen here
: \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{x} = - \nabla V \cdot d \mathbf{x} = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial x_i} \cdot dx_i = - dV 
which clearly suggests that only conservative forces can have potential energy associated with them; see conservation of energy.

Translational kinetic energy
The '''translational kinetic energy''' of an object is:

:E_{translational} = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 
where
:  m  is the mass (resistance to linear acceleration or deceleration);
:  v  is the velocity|linear velocity.

Rotational kinetic energy
The '''rotational kinetic energy''' of an object is:

:E_{rotational} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 
where
:  I  is the moment of inertia (resistance to angular acceleration or deceleration, equal to the product of the mass and the square of its perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation);
:  \omega \  is the angular velocity.
