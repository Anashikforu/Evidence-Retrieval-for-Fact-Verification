The '''Roscoe Wind Farm''' in Roscoe, Texas, was the world's largest wind farm (back in October 2009) with 627 wind turbines and a total installed capacity of 781.5 MW, which surpassed the nearby 735.5 MW Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center. The project cost more than $1 billion and provides enough power for more than 250,000 average Texan homes. It is located about 200 miles (320 kilometers) west of Fort Worth. The wind farm area spans parts of four Texas counties and covers nearly 100,000 acres, several times the size of Manhattan.
Unlike fossil-fueled power plants, wind farms require no water and generate no carbon dioxide -- a heat-trapping greenhouse gas that is a major contributory component for global warming.
