 Mathematics 
In mathematics, '''1''' is the Identity Property|multiplicative identity. It is sometimes called the "unity". It is also the only number for which these special facts are true:
 Any number n multiplied by 1 equals that number: n \times 1 = n. For example, 7\times1=7.
 Any number n divided by 1 equals that number: n/1=n. For example, 7/1=7.
 Any number n, other than 0, divided by itself always equals 1: n/n=1. For example: 7/7=1.
 1 cannot be divided by any other number bigger than itself so that the result is a natural number.

In mathematics, 0.999... is a repeating decimal that is equal to 1. Many mathematical proof|proofs have been made to show this is correct.
