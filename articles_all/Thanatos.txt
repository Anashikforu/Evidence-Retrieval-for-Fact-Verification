'''Thanatos''' is the Death (personification)|god of death in Greek mythology.  He is the son of Nyx and the twin brother of Hypnos, the god of sleep. 

Sigmund Freud, a famous psychology|psychologist, used the word in one of his theory|theories. THANATOS was the god or personified spirit (''daimon'') of non-violent death. His touch was gentle, likened to that of his twin brother Hypnos(Sleep). Violent death was the domain of Thanatos' blood-craving sisters, the Keres, spirits of slaughter and disease. He is often confused with Hades, who is the god of the dead and underworld, not death itself.

Thanatos plays a prominent role in two myths. Once when he was sent to fetch Alkestis (Alcestis) to the underworld, he was driven off by Herakles in a fight. Another time he was captured by the criminal Sisyphos (Sisyphus) who trapped him in a sack so as to avoid death.
