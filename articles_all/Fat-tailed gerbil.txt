The '''fat-tailed gerbil''' (''Pachyuromys duprasi'') is a species of gerbil. Its tail becomes fatter when it eats something. Then it uses it when food becomes scarce. They can live 5 to 7 years in captivity. It is from Africa.

They can survive a long time without drinking because they are adapted to a dry climate. 

They bury themselves under the sand until night so that there are not as many predators that will attack them.
