'''3200 Phaethon''', sometimes incorrectly spelt '''Phaeton''', is an Apollo asteroid and a dead comet.

It was announced on 14 October 1983 in IAUC 3878, with optical confirmation that it looks like an asteroid. It was the first asteroid to be found by a spacecraft. It measures 5.10&nbsp;km in diameter.

Phaethon approaches the Sun closer than any other numbered asteroid. Its perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) is only 0.140 astronomical unit|AU – less than half Mercury (planet)|Mercury's perihelion distance. It is a Mercury-crosser asteroid|Mercury-, Venus-crosser asteroid|Venus-, Earth-crosser asteroid|Earth- and Mars-crosser asteroid|Mars-crosser. The surface temperature at perihelion could reach ~1025 K, or 1400 F. For this reason, it was named after the Greek mythology|Greek myth of Phaëton, son of the sun god Helios.

Phaethon approached to 18.1&nbsp;Gm on 10 December 2007. It will draw nearer in 2017, 2050, 2060,  and closer still on 14 December 2093, passing within 0.0198&nbsp;astronomical unit|AU (3.0&nbsp; Gm).
