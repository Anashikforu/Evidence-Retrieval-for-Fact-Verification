Storm history

During mid-May, a disorganized low pressure area formed in the Atlantic Ocean about 290 miles (465 kilometers) south-southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina. The low pressure moved north and started to become more organized. On May 27, the storm was 120 miles (195&nbsp;km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina when the National Hurricane Center (NHC) decided to start monitoring the storm.

On May 28, the NHC started to monitor the storm again and on 11:00 am EDT (1500 UTC), they declared the storm to be a tropical cyclone and named it Tropical Depression One. At that time, the storm's location was about 310&nbsp;mi (500&nbsp;km) south of Providence, Rhode Island.


On May 29, the depression almost became a tropical storm, when the storm's strength was measured at T2.5, or 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h) using the Dvorak technique. But some of the measurements were also low as T1.5, which was the reason why the NHC didn't call it a tropical storm. After a quick burst of convection during the night, thunderstorm clouds inside the depression started to disappear by 3:00 am EDT (0700 UTC). By then, the tropical depression was no longer expected to strength anymore and was forecasted to weaken.
