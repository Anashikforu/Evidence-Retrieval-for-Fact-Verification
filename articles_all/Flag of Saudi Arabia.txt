The '''flag of Saudi Arabia''' is the flag used by the government of Saudi Arabia since March 15, 1973. It is a green flag featuring in white an Arabic language|Arabic inscription and a sword. 

The writing system|script on the flag is written in the ''Thuluth'' script. It is the ''shahadah'' or Islamic declaration of faith:

:''la ilaha ill allah muhammadun rasul allah''
:"There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his Messenger"

The sword, symbolizes the importance of the inscription by underlining it.
