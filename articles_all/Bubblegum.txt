'''Bubble gum''' is a popular type of candy that is not eaten, but instead chewed. Before being chewed bubble gum is hard. When it is chewed it is soft. It is called bubble gum, because once soft a person could create a bubble with the gum by blowing air into it. Bubble gum comes in many flavors.

Bubble gum is made with organic latex, a milky fluid produced by a variety of seed plants. Latex is also the principle component of rubber.

 It has water and sugar in it as well.

Bubble gum was invented in 1928 by Mr. Walter Diemer
