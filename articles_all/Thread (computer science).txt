A '''thread''' in computer science is short for a ''thread of execution''. Threads are a way for a computer program|program to ''split'' itself into two or more simultaneously (or pseudo-simultaneously) running task (computers)|tasks. Threads and process (computing)|processes differ from one operating system to another but, in general, a thread is contained inside a process and different threads in the same process share the same resources while different process (computing)|processes in the same multitasking operating system do not. Threads are lightweight, in terms of the system resources they consume, as compared with processes.
