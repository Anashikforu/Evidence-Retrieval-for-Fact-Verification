'''Renewable energy''' comes from Renewable resource|renewable resources.Resources that for all practical purposes cannot be :wikt:exhaust|exhausted): United States Department of Energy 
People have used traditional wind power, hydropower, biofuel, and solar energy for many centuries, all around the world. The mass production of electricity using renewable energy sources is now becoming more common.  
  


Growth of renewables
From the end of 2004, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60% annually for many technologies. For wind power and many other renewable technologies, growth sped up in 2009 relative to the previous four years. More wind power was added during 2009 than any other renewable technology. However, grid-connected PV increased the fastest of all renewables technologies, with a 60% annual average growth rate.  



Projections vary, but scientists have advanced a plan to power 100% of the world's energy with wind power|wind, hydroelectricity|hydroelectric, and solar power by the year 2030.

 Wind power market grows 
:''Main articles: Wind farm and List of large wind farms.''

Wind power capacity has expanded quickly to 743 Gigawatt|GW in 2020, and wind energy production was about 5% of total worldwide electricity usage, and growing fast. p. 9. These are some of the largest wind farms in the world, as of January 2010: 
 



A wind farm is a group of wind turbines in the same location used for production of electricity. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines distributed over an extended area, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore.

 World's largest PV power plants 


Solar photovoltaics|photovoltaic cells convert sunlight into electricity and many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built, mainly in Europe.Denis Lenardic. 
Solar is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the world. Solar energy capacity has increased by approximately 60% since 2013, rising to 485.82GW in 2018. 

 The ten largest solar power plants in the world '''('''based on installed capacity in 2020''')''' 

# Tengger Desert Solar Park, China – 1,547MW
# Sweihan Photovoltaic Independent Power Project, UAE – 1,177MW
# Yanchi Ningxia Solar Park, China – 1,000MW
# Datong Solar Power Top Runner Base, China – 1,070MW
# Kurnool Ultra Mega Solar Park, India – 1,000MW
# Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, China – 850MW
# Enel Villanueva PV Plant, Mexico – 828MW
# Kamuthi Solar Power Station, India – 648MW
# Solar Star Projects, US – 579MW
# Topaz Solar Farm / Desert Sunlight Solar Farm, US – 550MW

Many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use innovative tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed-mounted systems. There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations.

 New generation of solar thermal plants 





Large solar thermal power stations include the 354&nbsp;megawatt (MW) Solar Energy Generating Systems power installation in the USA, Solnova Solar Power Station (Spain, 150&nbsp;MW), Andasol solar power station (Spain, 100&nbsp;MW), Nevada Solar One (USA, 64&nbsp;MW), PS20 solar power tower (Spain, 20&nbsp;MW), and the PS10 solar power tower (Spain, 11&nbsp;MW). The 370 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, located in California's Mojave Desert, is the world’s largest solar thermal power plant project currently under construction.Todd Woody. 
The solar thermal power industry is growing fast with 1.2&nbsp;GW under construction as of April 2009 and another 13.9&nbsp;GW announced globally through 2014.  Spain is the epicenter of solar thermal power development with 22&nbsp;projects for 1,037&nbsp;MW under construction, all of which are projected to come online by the end of 2010. p.&nbsp;12.

Variable renewable energy
Variable renewable energy is a renewable energy source that is non-dispatchable due to its fluctuating nature, like wind power and solar power, as opposed to a controllable renewable energy source such as hydroelectricity, or biomass, or a relatively constant source such as geothermal power or run-of-the-river hydroelectricity. Critics of wind and solar power warn of their variable output, but many studies have shown that the grid can cope, and it is doing so in Wind power in Denmark|Denmark and Renewable energy in Spain|Spain.Amory Lovins (2011). ''Reinventing Fire'', Chelsea Green Publishing, p. 199.

The International Energy Agency says that there has been too much focus on issue of the variability. Its significance depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned, the balance of plant, and the wider connectivity of the system, as well as demand side flexibility. Variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment. But at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management.

 Ethanol for transportation 
Brazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world, involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18 percent of the country's automotive fuel. As a result, Brazil, which years ago had to import a large share of the petroleum needed for domestic consumption, recently reached complete self-sufficiency in oil.  

Most cars on the road today in the U.S. can run on blends of up to 10% ethanol, and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. Ford Motor Company|Ford, DaimlerChrysler, and General Motors Corporation are among the automobile companies that sell “flexible-fuel” cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol (E85). By mid-2006, there were approximately six million E85-compatible vehicles on U.S. roads.
