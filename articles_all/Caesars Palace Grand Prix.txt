The '''Caesars Palace Grand Prix''' was a Formula One Auto racing|motor race in 1981 and 1982. Nissan Motors|Nissan/Datsun was a presenting sponsor of both races.

When Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen left the F1 schedule after 1980, the Caesars Palace GP took its place. The track was set up in the parking lot of the Caesars Palace hotel. It was surprisingly well set up for a temporary circuit. It was wide enough for passing, provided ample run-off areas filled with sand, and had a surface that was as smooth as glass. Its counter-clockwise direction put a tremendous strain on the drivers' necks. 1982 was the end of Formula One racing in Las Vegas. The races had drawn only tiny crowds.

In 1983 and 1984, CART ran Grands Prix races on the same circuit.
