'''Cowes''' is an English seaport town on the Isle of Wight, an island south of Southampton. Cowes is on the west bank of the estuary of the River Medina facing the smaller town of '''East Cowes''' on the east Bank.  The western town is sometimes referred to as '''West Cowes''' where distinction is needed - such as at the two differing ferry landings.
