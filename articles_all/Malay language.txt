 Writing system 


Malay is normally written with the Latin alphabet called Latin alphabet|Rumi. But there is also a modified Arabic alphabet that is called Jawi script|Jawi. Rumi is official in Malaysia and Singapore, and the Indonesian language has a different official orthography that uses also the Latin script. Rumi and Jawi are  both official in Brunei. Efforts are currently being undertaken to preserve Jawi writing system|script and to revive its use amongst Malays in Malaysia, and students taking Malay language  examination in Malaysia have the option of answering questions using Jawi script.

Historically, Malay has been written in various types of script. Before the introduction of Arabic script in the Malay region, Malay was written using Vatteluttu|Pallava, Kawi script|Kawi and Rencong script|Rencong script and are still in use today by the Cham script|Champa Malay in Vietnam and Cambodia.
