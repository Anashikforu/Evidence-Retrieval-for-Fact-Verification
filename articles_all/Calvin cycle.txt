The '''Calvin cycle''' (also known as the '''Benson-Calvin cycle''') is the set of chemical reactions that take place in chloroplasts during photosynthesis.  

The cycle is Light-independent reaction|light-independent because it takes place after the energy has been captured from sunlight. 

The Calvin cycle is named after Melvin Calvin|Melvin C. Calvin, who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for finding it in 1961.

 Context 
Using the radioactive carbon-14 isotope as a wikt:trace|tracer, Melvin Calvin|Calvin, Andrew Benson and their team mapped the complete route that carbon travels through a plant during photosynthesis. They traced the carbon-14 from soaking up its atmospheric carbon dioxide to its conversion into carbohydrates and other organic compounds.{{Citation|pmid = 13383309

The Calvin group showed that sunlight acts on the chlorophyll in a plant to fuel the manufacture of organic compounds, not directly on carbon dioxide as previously believed.

Steps
The steps in the cycle are as follows:

1. Grab: A five-carbon carbon catcher called RuBP (Ribulose bisphosphate) wikt:catch|catches one molecule of carbon dioxide and forms a six-carbon molecule.

2. Split: the enzyme RuBisCO (with the energy of ATP and NADPH molecules) breaks the six-carbon molecule into two equal parts.

3. Leave: A trio of carbons leave and become sugar. The other trio moves on to the next step.

4. Switch: Using ATP and NADPH, the three carbon molecule is changed into a five carbon molecule.

5. The cycle starts over again.

The carbohydrate products of the Calvin cycle are three-carbon sugar phosphate molecules, or 'glucose triose phosphates' (G3P). Each step of the cycle has its own enzyme which speeds up the reaction.
