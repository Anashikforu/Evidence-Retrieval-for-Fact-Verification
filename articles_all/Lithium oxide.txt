'''Lithium oxide''' is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Li2O. It contains lithium and oxide ions.

Properties
Lithium oxide is a white solid. It is a strong base (chemistry)|base. It is corrosive when dissolved in water. Lithium oxide dissolves in water to make lithium hydroxide. It reacts with acids to make lithium salts. It reacts with carbon dioxide to form lithium carbonate. Lithium carbonate is much less corrosive. It makes a red color in a flame.

Preparation
When lithium is burned to air, it forms lithium oxide. This reaction also makes lithium nitride. It can also be made by heating lithium peroxide.

Uses
It is used as a wikt:flux|flux in glazing ceramics. It can be used in scientific research. It could also be used in Lithium-ion polymer battery|lithium ion batteries.

Safety
Lithium oxide is very corrosive. It reacts with water to make lithium hydroxide. It is toxic because of its strong alkali|alkalinity (being a Base (chemistry)|base).
