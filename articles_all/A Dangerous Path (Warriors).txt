 Plot 
Fireheart continues to struggle to care for ThunderClan, one of the warrior Clans in the forest, as Tigerstar tries to destroy ThunderClan. ThunderClan's leader, Bluestar, is no help at all, because she has gone insane from Tigerstar's betrayal. This time, Tigerstar plans to use a pack of dogs. He kills rabbits in ThunderClan territory, and leaves a trail from some rocks to the ThunderClan camp, with the body of a cat named Brindleface at the end, in order to lure the dogs to kill the warriors of ThunderClan. Once Fireheart discovers this, he takes ThunderClan to a place called Sunningrocks to hide. A line of fast warriors lead the dogs to their deaths in the gorge (a hole that goes very far down, with water at the bottom). Fireheart is the last in line, and has a good run until Tigerstar leaps out of nowhere and holds Fireheart down, letting the dogs catch Fireheart. Fireheart is trapped in the lead dog's mouth, but is rescued by Bluestar. She runs into the lead dog, who releases Fireheart, and the two fall down into the gorge. Fireheart saves Bluestar from the gorge and brings her to the shore, where she dies. Fireheart is filled with sadness for hisdead leader, and he is scared because he must become the new leader of ThunderClan.
