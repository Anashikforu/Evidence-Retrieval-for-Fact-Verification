'''916 America''' is a minor planet that is orbiting the Sun in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter.

It was discovered on 7 August 1915 by the Soviet astronomer Grigory Nikolaevich Neujmin at Simeis, Ukraine. It was originally called '''916ΣI''', but was renamed ''916 America'' on 24 February 1923 after the Council of Astronomers at Pulkovo Observatory decided to pay tribute to "the friendly relations of the astronomical observatories and astronomers".
In 1986, believing that the asteroid was of S-type and that it had a diameter of 15&nbsp;km, the length of 916 America's day was thought to be 38 hours. Observations by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite have since shown that it has a diameter of 33.2±1.3&nbsp;km, with an absolute magnitude of 11.20 and an albedo (the extent to which it reflects light) of 0.053±0.004.
