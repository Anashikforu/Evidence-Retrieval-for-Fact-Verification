Layer cakes are usually decorated with frosting, and so most coconut cakes have frosting on them. There are 330 calories in a slice of the Coconut Cake.

 Coconut flavor 
The coconut flavor comes from the coconut cream between the layers of the cake. Coconut cream is made from the liquid that is on the surface of coconut milk. Sweetened coconut is also sprinkled over the whole cake as a last touch.
