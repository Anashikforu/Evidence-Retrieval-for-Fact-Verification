In geology, a '''rift''' is caused by tectonic plates in the Earth's lithosphere moving apart. Rifts are usually accompanied by orogeny (mountain building), volcanoes and earthquakes.

A rift is the result of the pulling apart or extension of the continental crust|crust  and lithosphere. Mantle upwelling brings hotter asthenosphere up into the colder lithosphere. Sometime it comes out as lava. This rise occurs with the thinning and stretching of the lithosphere.
