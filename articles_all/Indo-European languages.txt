The '''Indo-European languages''' are the world's most spoken language family. 

Linguist|Linguists believe they all come from a single language, Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European, which was originally spoken somewhere in Eurasia. They are now spoken all over the world.

The Indo-European languages are a language family|family of several hundred related List of Indo-European languages|languages and dialects,It is composed of 449 languages and dialects, according to the 2005 Ethnologue estimate, about half (219) belonging to the Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan sub-branch. including most major languages in Europe, the Iranian plateau, and South Asia.

Historically, the language family was also important in Anatolia and Central Asia. 

The earliest Indo-European writing is from the Bronze Age in Anatolia|Anatolian and Mycenaean Greek language|Greek. The origin of Proto-Indo-European is after the invention of farming since some of its words have to do with farming.

Although it may have fewer languages than some other language families, it has the most native speakers, about 2.7 billion. 

Of the 20 languages with the most speakers, 12 are Indo-European: English language|English, Spanish language|Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese language|Portuguese, Bengali language|Bengali, Russian language|Russian, German language|German, Sindhi language|Sindhi, Punjabi language|Punjabi, Marathi language|Marathi, French language|French, and Urdu.

 History of Indo-European linguistics 
Suggestions of similarities between Indian and European languages began to be made by European visitors to India in the 16th century. In 1583, Thomas Stephens, an English Jesuit missionary in Goa, India, noticed similarities between the Indian languages and Greek and Latin and included them included in a letter to his brother, but it was not published until the 20th century.

The first account to mention Sanskrit is from Filippo Sassetti. Born in Florence, Italy, in 1540, he was a merchant who was among the first Europeans to study Sanskrit. Writing in 1585, he noted some word similarities between Sanskrit and Italian such as ''devaḥ''/''dio'' "God", ''sarpaḥ''/''serpe'' "serpent", ''sapta''/''sette'' "seven", ''aṣṭa''/''otto'' "eight", ''nava''/''nove'' "nine"). However, neither observation led to further scholarly inquiry.

In 1647, the Dutch people|Dutch linguist and scholar Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn noted the similarity among Indo-European languages and supposed that they had derived from a primitive common language. He included in his hypothesis Dutch language|Dutch, Greek language|Greek, Latin language|Latin, Persian language|Persian, and German language|German, and he later added Slavic languages|Slavic, Celtic languages|Celtic, and Baltic languages. However, his suggestions did not become widely known and did not stimulate further research.

Gaston Coeurdoux and others had made similar observations. Coeurdoux made a thorough comparison of Sanskrit, Latin, and Greek conjugations in the late 1760s to suggest a relationship between the languages. Similarly, Mikhail Lomonosov compared different languages groups of the world, including Slavic, Baltic, Iranian, Finnish, Chinese, Hottentot and others.(transl.) 'Imagine the depth of time when these languages separated!... Polish and Russian separated so long ago! Think when this happened to Latin, Greek, German, and Russian! Oh, great antiquity!'

The hypothesis reappeared in 1786, 20 years after Coeurdoux, when Sir William Jones lectured on the striking similarities between three of the oldest languages known in his time: Latin, Greek language|Greek, and Sanskrit. He later tentatively added Gothic language|Gothic, Celtic languages|Celtic, and Old Persian language|Old Persian
In 1813, Thomas Young was first to use the term ''Indo-European''.In ''London Quarterly Review X/2 1813.; cf. Szemerényi 1999:12, footnote 6 It became the standard scientific term except in GermanyIn German it is ''indogermanisch'' 'Indo-Germanic' which indicates the east-west extension, but omits the Italic languages. through Franz Bopp's ''Comparative Grammar''. Appearing between 1833 and 1852, it was the starting point of Indo-European studies as an academic discipline. 

Some 20th-century scholars thought Indo-European languages started in Armenia or India, but most now think that it started in Eastern Europe or Anatolia.
