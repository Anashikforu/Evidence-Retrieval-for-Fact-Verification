Venetian red (haematite), Magnetite (Fe3O4), or a mixture of oxides make black or purple pigments. The umber, sienna and ochre are oxides or hydrated oxides of a yellow to chestnut (color)|chestnut color|colour.

Most iron oxide is mined as iron ore. Every year millions of tons go into blast furnaces to make iron.
