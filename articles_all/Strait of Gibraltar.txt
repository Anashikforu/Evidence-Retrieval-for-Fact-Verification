The '''Strait of Gibraltar''' is the only water passage between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is between Europe and Africa; on one side is the southern tip of Spain and Gibraltar, and on the other is northern Morocco and Ceuta.Â The distance between the Rock of Gibraltar and Morocco is only 7.7 nautical miles (14.24 kilometers, 8.9 miles) at its narrowest point.
The water depth ranges between 300 and 900 meters.
