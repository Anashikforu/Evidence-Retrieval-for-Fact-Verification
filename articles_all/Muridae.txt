'''Muridae''' is the largest family of mammals.  It contains over 700 species. These species can be found naturally throughout Eurasia, Africa, and Australia.  They have been introduced worldwide.  The group includes true mouse|mice and rats, gerbils, and relatives.

The family name Muridae is sometimes used in a broader sense to include all members of the superfamily Muroidea.

The Murids are classified in four subfamily|subfamilies, and about 140 genus|genera.

Subfamilies

Deomyinae (spiny mice, brush furred mice, link rat)
Gerbillinae (gerbils, jirds and sand rats)
Leimacomyinae (Togo mouse)
Lophiomyinae (Crested rat)
Murinae (Old World rats and mice including the vlei rats)
