'''Yatton''' is a large village with 9,000 people in the county of Somerset in England. Archaeology in the area has found a Ancient Rome|Roman villa (country-house) belonging to some rich person who lived here in the late 3rd century, judging from the coins. Records show the land was part of the manor of John the Dane before the Norman Conquest, and Giso, bishop of Wells afterward.
