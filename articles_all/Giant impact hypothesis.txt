The '''giant impact hypothesis''' is that the Moon was created out of the debris from a collision between the young Earth and a Mars-sized protoplanet. This is the favoured scientific hypothesis for the formation of the Moon.

Evidence for this hypothesis comes from Moon samples which show that:
#the surface of the Moon was once molten 
#the Moon's apparently relatively small iron core (geology)|core and a lower density than the Earth, and 
#evidence of similar collisions in other star systems (which result in 'debris disks')

The colliding body is sometimes called Theia for the mythical Greece|Greek Titan (mythology)|Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the moon.Halliday, Alex N. 2000. Terrestrial accretion rates and the origin of the Moon. ''Earth and Planetary Science Letters'' '''176''' (1): 17–30. doi:10.1016/S0012-821X(99)00317-9.Wiechert U; Halliday A.N; Lee D-C; Snyder G.A; Taylor LA; Rumble D. 2001. Science. ''Science'' '''294''' (12): 345–348. doi:10.1126/science.1063037. PMID 11598294. 
There are several unanswered issues with this hypothesis. Lunar oxygen isotopic ratios are essentially identical to Earth, with no evidence of a contribution from another solar body. Also, lunar samples do not have expected ratios of volatile elements, iron oxide, or siderophilic elements (chemical elements which bond with iron), and there is no evidence that the Earth ever had the magma ocean implied by the hypothesis.

 Context 
The Earth's relatively large natural satellite, the Moon, is unique.The Earth's Moon is larger relative to its planet than any other satellite in the solar system. Pluto's satellite Charon (moon)|Charon is relatively larger, but Pluto is considered a dwarf planet. During the Apollo program, rocks from the Moon's surface were brought to Earth. Radiometric dating of these rocks has shown the Moon to be 4527 ± 10 million years old, about 30 to 55 million years younger than other bodies in the solar system.Kleine ''et al.'' 2005. Hf-W chronometry of lunar metals and the age and early differentiation of the Moon. ''Science'' '''310''', 1671–1674.Halliday A.N. 2006. ''The origin of the Earth; what's new?'' ''Elements'' '''2''' 205-210. New evidence suggests the Moon formed even later, 4.48±0.02 Ga, or 70–110 Ma after the start of the Solar System.Halliday, Alex N 2008. A young Moon-forming giant impact at 70–110 million years accompanied by late-stage mixing, core formation and degassing of the Earth. ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society''. '''366''', 4163-4181. doi:10.1098/rsta.2008.0209. 
The impactor, sometimes called Theia, is thought to have been a little smaller than the planet Mars. Theia collided with Earth about 4.533 Ga.Münker, Carsten ''et al.'' 2003. Evolution of planetary cores and the Earth-Moon system from Nb/Ta systematics. ''Science'' '''301''' (5629): 84–87. doi:10.1126/science.1084662. PMID 12843390. 
However, the metallic cores of the impactor would have sunk through the Earth's mantle to fuse with the Earth's core, depleting the Moon of metallic material.Liu L-G. 1992. Chemical composition of the Earth after the giant impact. ''Earth, Moon, and Planets'' '''57''', 85-97. The giant impact hypothesis thus explains the Moon's abnormal composition.Newsom H.E. & Taylor S.R. 1989. Geochemical implications of the formation of the Moon by a single giant impact. ''Nature'' '''338''', 29-34. The ejecta in orbit around the Earth could have condensed into a single body within weeks. Under the influence of its own gravity, the ejected material became a more spherical body: the Moon.

The radiometric ages show the Earth existed already for at least 10 million years before the impact, enough time to allow for Planetary differentiation|differentiation of the Earth's primitive mantle and core. Then, when the impact occurred, only material from the mantle was ejected, leaving the Earth's core of heavy elements untouched.

= Consequences =
The impact had some important consequences for the young Earth. It released an enormous amount of energy, causing both the Earth and Moon to be completely molten. Immediately after the impact, the Earth's mantle was vigorously convection|convecting, the surface was a large magma ocean. The planet's first atmosphere must have been completely blown away by the enormous amount of energy released.Benz W. & Cameron A.G.W. 1990. Terrestrial effects of the giant impact. ''LPI Conference on the Origin of the Earth''. 61-67. The impact is also thought to have changed Earth’s axis to produce the large 23.5° axial tilt that is responsible for Earth’s seasons (a simple, ideal model of the planets’ origins would have axial tilts of 0° with no recognizable seasons). It may also have sped up Earth’s rotation.

 Recent evidence 
Analysis of lunar rock brought back by Apollo astronauts appears to show traces of Theia. The researchers claim this confirms the theory that the Moon was created by a cataclysmic collision.Ghosh, Pallab 2014. Traces of another world found on the Moon. ''BBC News'' Science & Environment.
