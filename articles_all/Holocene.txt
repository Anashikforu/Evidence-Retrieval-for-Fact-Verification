The '''Holocene''' is the present geology|geological epoch. It is the second epoch of the Quaternary and the seventh of the Cainozoic. It started around 11,000 years ago after the last ice age. We are currently going through a non-ice age warm stage in Earth's history.

 Holocene climatic optimum 
The '''Holocene climatic optimum''' (HCO) was a warm period from about 9,000 to 5,000 years Before present|BP. The interesting thing about this is, despite recent global warming, we are still below this warm period (see diagram). 

This warm period was followed by a gradual decline until about two millennia ago.

 More details 
The Holocene is also called the '''Recent''' epoch. It is the second stage in the Quaternary period.

The Holocene marks the end of the previous series of ice ages in the Pleistocene. It started about 11,700 years ago when the temperatures rose quickly from the previous level.

During the early Holocene, there were many extinctions amongst larger mammals. This is because of human hunting and climate change.Martin P.S. and Klein R.G. eds 1984. ''Quaternary extinctions: a prehistoric revolution''. Arizona, Tucson AZ.Roberts, Neil 1998. The Holocene: an environmental history. 2nd ed, Blackwell, Malden, MA. 

At this time the Bering bridge connecting Russia and Alaska melted. Also the land bridge between China and Japan melted (starting the J≈çmon period), as well as many land bridges between islands in Southeast Asia.
