'''''Work It Out''''' is a funk song written by United States|American singer-songwriter Beyoncé Knowles and The Neptunes members Pharrell|Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo (who produced the track) for the soundtrack to the 2002 film ''Austin Powers in Goldmember''—in which she plays Foxxy Cleopatra—and was later featured on the non-U.S. editions of Knowles' solo debut album, ''Dangerously in Love'' (2003). Released as a single (music)|single in June 2002, it failed to chart on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100, but did experience moderate success on the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Club Play chart, debuting at number forty-nine and later peaking at number eleven. Nevertheless, it was a relative hit in European countries such as the United Kingdom and Norway, where it reached number seven and number three respectively. The music video for the song was directed by Matthew Rolston. This funky number features Chad Hugo on the saxophone.
