Travels in Search of National Anthems''. London: Random House Books. pp. 140–144. ISBN 9781847947413. 'Imagine if someone came and tried to break up London,' Shamshi Kaldayakov's son Mukhtar says, hitting a table in disgust. 'It's just like that. My father composed the song to stop them doing this. "Don't do it. This is our land."' The tune was composed by Shamshi Kaldayakov|Shámshi Qaldaıaqov with lyrics (words) by Jumeken Nájimedenov. In 2006, the first president of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev revised (changed) the lyrics before becoming the anthem.

Parodies
There is a parody version of the anthem—in an entirely different tune—which comes at the end of 2005 mockumentary film ''Borat''. It is titled "O Kazakhstan". The actor who played Borat Sagdiyev, Sacha Baron Cohen, has been threatened with lawsuits by the Government of Kazakhstan after the execution (release) of the film.
Playback incidents
In March 2012, the full ''Borat'' soundtrack was played at the International Shooting Grand Prix in Kuwait with Gold-winner Mariya Dmitriyenko.
