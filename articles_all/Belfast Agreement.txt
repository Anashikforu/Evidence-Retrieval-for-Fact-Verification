The '''Belfast Agreement''', also known as the '''Good Friday Agreement''', was a political agreement in the Northern Ireland peace process during The Troubles. It was signed in Belfast on 10 April 1998 (Good Friday) by the British and Irish governments and it was supported by most of the political parties in Northern Ireland. On 23 May 1998 the Agreement got the support of the voters of Northern Ireland in a referendum. Also on the same day, voters in the Republic of Ireland voted separately to change their constitution in line with the Agreement. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) was the only large party in the whole of Ireland that was against the Agreement.
