The '''Fukushima nuclear disaster''' is a series of ongoing equipment failures, reactor meltdowns, and Radiation accidents|releases of radioactive materials at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011.

At the time of the quake, reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. The remaining reactors shut down automatically after the earthquake, but the entire plant was flooded, including low-lying generators and electrical switchgear in reactor basements and external pumps for supplying cooling seawater. The connection to the electrical grid was broken. All power for cooling was lost and reactors started to overheat. There was a partial nuclear meltdown|core meltdown in reactors 1, 2, and 3; hydrogen explosions destroyed the upper part of the buildings housing reactors 1, 3, and 4; an explosion damaged the containment inside reactor 2; fires broke out at reactor 4. Despite being initially shutdown, reactors 5 and 6 began to overheat. Spent nuclear fuel rods stored in pools in each reactor building overheated as water levels in the pools dropped.

Fears of radiation leaks led to a 20&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) radius evacuation around the plant while workers suffered radiation exposure and were temporarily moved out at various times. Grid power was restored to parts of the plant on 20 March, but machinery for reactors 1 through 4, damaged by floods, fires and explosions, was still not working.
Tokyo officials said that tap water should not be used to prepare food for children.
The nuclear emergencies at Japan's Fukushima I and other nuclear facilities raised questions about the future of nuclear power.
