History
The first Duchy of Saxe-Eisenach was created in 1596 for Johann Ernst, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach|Johann Ernst, younger son of Johann Frederick II, Duke of Saxony|Johann Frederick II of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach.

In 1633, the Wettin line died out, and Johann Ernst inherited it, but he died heirless in 1638, and the territories of Saxe-Gotha and Saxe-Eisenach were split between Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Altenburg.

In 1640 Saxe-Eisenach was again separated off from Saxe-Weimar for Albert IV, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach|Albert, son of John II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|John II of Saxe-Weimar, but after just four years he too died without an heir, and Saxe-Eisenach was then divided between Saxe-Gotha and Saxe-Weimar, ruled by his brothers Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha|Ernst and Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Wilhelm.

In 1662 Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Weimar died, leaving four children: Johann Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Johann Ernst, Adolf Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach|Adolf Wilhelm, John George I, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach|Johann Georg and Bernhard II, Duke of Saxe-Jena|Bernhard. Adolf Wilhelm, got Eisenach, but he had to share this with his younger brother Johann Georg. Johann Georg eventually took an allowance from the duchy instead of taking part in the government, and moved to live in the small town of Marksuhl. Adolf William’s first four sons died soon after birth. In 1668 he died, just before of the birth of his fifth child, William August, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach|Wilhelm August, who became the new Duke of Saxe-Eisenach from his birth, with Johann Georg as regent. A sickly boy, he died in 1671 at only two years old, and Johann Georg I became the duke of Saxe-Eisenach.

Saxe-Eisenach changed again in 1672. Frederick Wilhelm III, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Frederick William III of Saxe-Altenburg died and his lands were split. The line of Johann Georg I ruled Saxe-Eisenach for 69 years, until Duke Wilhelm Heinrich, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach|Wilhelm Heinrich died heirless in 1741. Ernest August I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Ernst August I of Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm's second cousin, inherited Saxe-Eisenach; he and his successors ruled Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Eisenach in a personal union until 1809, when the duchies were formally merged into the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.
