The British Rail '''Class 166''' "Network Express Turbo" diesel multiple units (also known as just '''"Thames Turbos"'''    ) were built by Asea Brown Boveri|ABB at York Works from 1992-93. These units are the express version of the British Rail Class 165|Class 165 "Network Turbo" units. They have a top speed of 90mph (suitable for mainline use), are carpeted throughout and have air-conditioning (the 165s lack the latter two features and it should be noted the 166 is similar to the British Rail Class 158|Class 158 in terms of what it offers).
