Harold was the son of Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and Gytha, a Danish noblewoman.Orderic Vitalis, ''The Ecclesiastical History of Orderic Vitalis'', Volume II, Books III And IV, ed. Marjorie Chibnall (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1993), p. 216 His sister, Edith, was married to the king he succeeded, Edward the Confessor.''The Chronicle of Florence of Worcester; With the Two Continuations'', trans. Thomas Forester (London: Henry G. Bohn; New York: AMS Press, 1854), pp. 150-52 About that same time Harold became Earl of East Anglia.Frank Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 561569 When his father died in 1053, Harold inherited his earldom of Wessex. 

Elfgar, son of Leofric of Mercia was appointed to replace Harold in East Anglia. Berkshire and Somerset were joined to Wessex again. Wessex itself was, in those days, an enormous amount of land that covered about a third of England. Harold ruled over a large portion of England, making him the most powerful man in the whole kingdom, after the King.

In September 1066 Harold Godwinson defeated an invasion from the north by Harald Hardrada. He returned south to fight Duke William's invasion. He was killed, it is generally assumed, by an arrow shot by one of William's archers, but some reports say he was cut down by many soldiers.
