A '''point''' is a precise position in Space (physics)|space. Imagine touching a piece of paper with a sharp pencil or pen, without making any sideways movement. We know where the point is, but it has no size to speak of.

In geometry, a point has no size, but has a position. This means it has no volume, area or length. We usually represent a point by a small cross 'X' or by a small '''dot''' (a small, round shape). Points are always labelled by capital letters (A, B, C...X, Y, Z).

In general, '''two points''' can be:
 Coincident (they are one and the same)
 Not coincident (they are not one and the same)
and are always:
 Coplanar (on the same plane)
 Colinear (on the same line)
 Concyclic (on the same circle)

'''Three points''' can be:
 Colinear
 Coincident
 Not coincident
 Not colinear
and are always:
 Coplanar
 Concyclic

'''Four points''' can be: 
 Coplanar
 Colinear
 Coincident
 Not coincident
 Not colinear
 Not coplanar
