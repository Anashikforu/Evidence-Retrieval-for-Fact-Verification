Extension to Camberwell
The extension to Camberwell was a plan to extend the Bakerloo Line. The project was to start at the late 1940s, but they cancelled it for an unknown reason. Then in the 21st century, they revised the extension plan and proposed it again. So far, nothing has been agreed. The 1940s version of the extension had two stations. One rumour of why they cancelled the project was because Camberwell was quite a bad location to do further extensions.
