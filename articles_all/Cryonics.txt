'''Cryonics''' (from Ancient Greek|Greek ''kryos'', which means 'cold') is the process of :en:wikt:vitrifying|vitrifying a human (or animal) about  after a Medical doctor|doctor says they are dead. People do that in hope that, in the future when medicine becomes better, they can have life again, solve their health problems and have Immortality|eternal life.

Cold people like this are not awake at all as they have Brain death|no brain activity. The law also says they are dead.

To do this, their blood is replaced with chemicals called ''cryoprotectants'', which act like anti-freeze (stops to freeze).
