Gorgonopsids were a successful group which lived during the Permian|Permian period, about 260 million years ago. They became extinct in the Permianâ€“Triassic extinction event. 

They were the major predators of their day. They had large, powerful, square-shaped jaws with huge, sabre-like canine and interlaced, socket-like teeth. Many fossils have been found in South Africa.

The largest known, ''Inostrancevia'', was the size of a large bear with a 45&nbsp;cm long skull, and 12-cm long sabre-like teeth.  

The '''Gorgonopsidae''' are divided into three sub-families: 
Rubidginae, which had large, broad skulls,
Gorgonopsinae, which included most of the gorgonopsid genera.
