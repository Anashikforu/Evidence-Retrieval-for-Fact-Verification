The opening and closing ceremonies and the events grouped as ice sports (excluding bobsleigh, luge and skeleton) were held in Vancouver and Richmond. The sports grouped as "Nordic events" were held in the Callaghan Valley near Whistler. All alpine skiing events were held on Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler Mountain (Creekside) and sliding events (bobsleigh, luge and skeleton) were held on Whistler, British Columbia|Blackcomb Mountain.  Cypress Mountain was the place for the freestyle skiing (aerials, moguls and ski cross), and all snowboard events (half-pipe, parallel giant slalom, snowboard cross).

Vancouver 2010 was the first winter Olympics that both men's and women's hockey were played on a narrower, National Hockey League|NHL-sized ice rink, measuring 200&nbsp;ft&nbsp;× 85&nbsp;ft (61&nbsp;m&nbsp;× 26&nbsp;m), instead of the international size of 200&nbsp;ft&nbsp;× 98.5&nbsp;ft (61&nbsp;m&nbsp;× 30&nbsp;m). The games were played at General Motors Place, home of the NHL's Vancouver Canucks, which was temporarily renamed Canada Hockey Place for the time of the Olympics. This change saved $10&nbsp;million in wikt|construction costs and allowed an additional 35,000 spectators to attend Olympic hockey games.
