A '''dictionary attack''' is a method used in cryptography to find a key (cryptography)|key (or username, or password). A large number of words are tried. These words usually come from a special collection, called a "dictionary". 

The attack is based on trying all the strings in a pre-arranged listing. The listing is usually derived from a list of words, such as in a dictionary (hence the phrase ''dictionary attack'').Jeff Atwood.
