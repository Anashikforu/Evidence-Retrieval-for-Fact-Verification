'''Dark matter''' is a type of matter thought to be responsible for much of the mass in the universe.

The idea arose when astronomers found that the mass of large astronomical objects, and their gravitational effects, was much greater than the mass from the "luminous matter" that contains stars, gas, and dust.

Dark matter was first proposed by Jan Oort in 1932 as a reason for the spinning speeds of stars in the Milky Way. Fritz Zwicky in 1933 used dark matter to explain "missing mass" in the spinning speeds of galaxy|galaxies in galaxy cluster|clusters. Later, many other observations have suggested that there is dark matter in the universe. The spinning speeds of galaxies,

Because dark matter does not seem to give off or reflect light, x-rays, or any other electromagnetic radiation|radiation, the instruments that are used to find normal matter (like hot gas, stars, planets, and us) can't find dark matter. It seems that dark matter is not made of the same thing as the matter we see every day on Earth. The only way we can tell if dark matter is there, is by how it affects things we can "see" by gravity.

In 2006, a group of scientists claimed that they had found a way to find dark matter.Amos, Jonathan 2006. Dark matter comes out of the cold. BBC News
