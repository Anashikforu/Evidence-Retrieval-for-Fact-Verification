'''Prospero''' is a small Prograde and retrograde motion|retrograde non-Sphere|spherical moon of Uranus (planet)|Uranus found on 1999-07-18 by the astrophysicist Matthew Holman and his team, and given designation '''S/1999&nbsp;U&nbsp;3'''. Confirmed as '''Uranus&nbsp;XVIII''' it was named after the sorcerer Prospero in William Shakespeare's play ''The Tempest''.

The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong, together with Sycorax (moon)|Sycorax and Setebos (moon)|Setebos to the same dynamic cluster, suggesting common origin.
