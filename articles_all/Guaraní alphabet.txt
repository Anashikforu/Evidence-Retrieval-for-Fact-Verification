The '''Guaraní alphabet''' is a system used to write the Guaraní language. The Guaraní language is used in Paraguay and some countries near it. The alphabet has 35 letters. These are:
:A, tilde|Ã, CH, E, tilde|Ẽ, F, G, tilde|G̃, H, I, tilde|Ĩ, J, K, L, M, MB, N, ND, NG, NJ, NT, tilde|Ñ, O, tilde|Õ, P, R, RR, S, T, U, tilde|Ũ, V, Y, tilde|Ỹ, apostrophe|ʼ.

"A", "E", "I", "O", "U", "Y" are vowels, just like English. Those letters with tildes on top make the same sound, except more nasal sounding. The apostrophe sounds like a glottal stop. The other letters are consonants.
