The two ran into name conflict when Screen Actors Guild rules stopped the same stage naming. Vanessa A. had registered the name "Vanessa Williams" first. As a compromise, Williams was occasionally credited as "Vanessa L. Williams" in acting credits. Both actresses starred in versions of the drama ''Soul Food (film)|Soul Food'' (Williams in the film version, and Vanessa A. in its ''Soul Food'' adaptation). The Screen Actors Guild eventually took the issue to arbitration, and decided that both actresses could use the professional name "Vanessa Williams". Today, Williams' prominence has led to a more wide association with the stage name "Vanessa Williams", so much so that it has widely become only known to her. She is credited as such in the American television series ''Ugly Betty'' and ''Desperate Housewives''.  Williams is also the owner of the internet domain name vanessawilliams.com.
