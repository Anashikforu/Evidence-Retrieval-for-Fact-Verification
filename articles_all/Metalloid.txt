A '''metalloid''' or '''semimetal''' is a chemical element. Metalloids are elements that have the properties of both metal and non-metal elements. It might be shiny, but brittle. It might be dull, but conducts electricity.

The most common semimetal is silicon. Silicon has electrical wikt:conductivity|conductivity between metals and nonmetals. It is a semiconductor.




An approximate way to classify metalloids is to look at the Periodic Table of elements. See the double diagonal line: top left Boron and Aluminium, bottom right Polonium and Astatine. Those diagonals are the metalloids. Some metalloids are not semimetals, and some semimetals are not metalloids.
