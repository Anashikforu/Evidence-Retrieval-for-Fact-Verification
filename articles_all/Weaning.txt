'''Weaning''' means changing the diet of a baby little by little, from its Breastfeeding|mother's milk to the food it will eat as an adult.  Since only female mammals make milk, weaning is only a necessary process for mammals.  When a baby does not drink any more breast milk (or milk substitute), the baby has been weaned.

Human weaning
Human babies should start eating small amounts of solid food, along with breast milk or formula, when they are about six months old.  Before this time, a child's digestion|digestive system and kidneys are still forming, so the child is not ready for solid food.

Babies do not have tooth|teeth and cannot chew their food, so they are usually fed soft, runny food such as cooked mashed fruit or vegetables.  Babies cannot digest some foods which adults can eat, including food with nut (fruit)|nuts or with large amounts of gluten, salt or sugar.  Also, babies' digestive systems are very sensitive to bacteria, so they should not eat any foods with honey, egg (food)|eggs or shellfish in them because these foods sometimes contain bacteria.
Weaning conflict
Weaning conflict happens when the mother wants to wean her baby, but the baby wants to keep breastfeeding.Salmon, C. & Shackelford, T.K. (2008). ''Family Relationships: An Evolutionary Perspective''. Oxford University Press. pp. 148–149.  pp. 1269–1275. Retrieved 23 September 2009.
