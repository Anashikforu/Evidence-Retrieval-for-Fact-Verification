The '''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems''' 10th Revision ('''ICD-10''') is list of codes that classify diseases and medical problems. The ICD is published by the World Health Organization. There have been many revisions, or updated versions, of the ICD. Work on the latest version, ICD-10, began in 1983 and was finished in 1992.
The ICD gives a special, unique code to:
Every medical condition (including Mental illness|mental health problems)
Specific symptoms, if it is not clear what condition is causing the symptom. (For example, if a person has a cough, but his doctor does not know why, he would just use the ICD code for "Cough".)
Changes in the body, or test results that are not normal (if it is not clear what condition is causing these changes).
Injury|Injuries or illnesses that are caused by things outside of the body (for example, Fracture|broken bones, burns, and poisonings)
Social issues that may cause health problems (for example, if a person's job causes health risks, or if the person's health is at risk because of poverty).
