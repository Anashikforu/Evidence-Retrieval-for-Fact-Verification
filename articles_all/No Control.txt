'''''No Control''''' is the fourth album by American punk rock band Bad Religion, released on the Californian independent record label Epitaph Records on November 2, 1989. It was the follow-up to the band's highly acclaimed reunion album ''Suffer (album)|Suffer''.

Like the previous Bad Religion album, many people consider ''No Control'' to be one of the best punk albums of the 1980s, while some consider it to be the band's finest effort, featuring "Change of Ideas", "No Control", "I Want to Conquer the World", "Big Bang" and "You", all of which are staples of their live show to this day.

Stylistically, ''No Control'' is a faster album than its predecessor, owing more to hardcore punk.
