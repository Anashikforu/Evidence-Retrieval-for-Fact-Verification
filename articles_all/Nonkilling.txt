'''Nonkilling''' is a worldview that affirms the possibility of a society where killing is absent. In such a society there would be no killings, threats to kill, weapons made to kill or reasons for people to kill each other.Glenn D. Paige, ''Nonkilling Global Political Science.'' Center for Global Nonkilling, 2002; 3rd ed. 2009, page 1.
