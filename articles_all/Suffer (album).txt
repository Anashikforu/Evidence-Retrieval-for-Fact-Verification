'''''Suffer''''' is the third album by American punk rock band Bad Religion. It was released on the Californian independent record label Epitaph Records on September 8, 1988. It was the first album that was both made and sold by the label.

After the release of the Extended play|EP ''Back to the Known'' (1985), the band set some time apart to rest. Later, the original members got back together and went to work on its first full-length studio album in five years.

Similar to their next album ''No Control'' (1989), many people consider ''Suffer'' to be one of the best punk albums of the 1980s. The album became Epitaph's best-selling album for a number of years, until the release of The Offspring's popular ''Smash (album)|Smash'' album in 1994. A large number of third-wave punk bands cite this album as a big influence on their work. NOFX's Fat Mike has called it "the record that changed everything."
