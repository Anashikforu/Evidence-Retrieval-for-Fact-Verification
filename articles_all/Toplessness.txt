'''Toplessness''' (or being '''topless''') is a state of a woman not wearing any clothing above the waist, meaning the breasts are visible. The term used for a male is '''barechestedness''' or '''shirtlessness'''.

Because the female breast is often associated with sexuality, some countries consider it alright for men to be topless in public, but not women. However many countries consider it usual for women to be topless, even due to the natural heat.
