A '''warehouse''' is a commercial building for storage of goods. Warehouses are used by manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers, transport businesses, customs, etc.  They are usually large plain buildings in industrial areas of cities and towns.  They have loading docks to load and unload trucks; or sometimes are loaded directly from railways, airports, or seaports.  They also often have crane (machine)|cranes and forklifts for moving goods, which are usually placed on ISO standard pallets loaded into pallet racks.

In logistics, the warehouse performs the function of accumulating reserves of material resources necessary to dampen fluctuations in supply and demand volumes, as well as synchronizing the flow rates of goods in systems of promotion from manufacturers to consumers or material flows in technological production systems.
