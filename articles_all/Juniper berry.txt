The '''juniper berry''' is the female seed cone made by the different species|kinds of junipers. It is not a true berry, but its unusual roundness and merged scales make it look like a berry. Some of the cones are used as spices. Juniper berries are also used to flavour gin. According to a Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO document, juniper berries are the only spice that comes from conifers.
