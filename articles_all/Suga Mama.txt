 Music video and other promotion 
The "Suga Mama" music video was released to UK music channels in April 2007.
Knowles rehearsed the pole dancing using two ballet bars, which was when it was decided to add a pole above her head to form an arc. Though Knowles is from Texas, she had never previously been on mechanical bull. There were no problems during warm-ups, but the man operating the bull during the video shoot programmed it to go faster, causing Knowles to fall off when she tried to perform tricks such as lifting up her foot, leaning back and turning around. To minimise the time Knowles spent on the bull, the director shot the sequence at twelve film frame|frames per second (see frame rate) and Knowles sang twice as quickly, but it was not until 4:00 a.m. that they completed work.Vineyard, Jennifer. 
"Suga Mama" was included on the set list of Knowles's 2007 tour, The Beyoncé Experience, and ''The Tennessean'' wrote that the song "was even sexier and more gutbucket than on record".Friskics-Warren, Bill.
