 Critical reception 
"I Kissed a Girl" has drawn mixed reviews from critics. ''Blogcritics Magazine'' called it "an instantly catchy number,"Cockrell, Garon (2008). 
However, Rolling Stone, while giving her album 2/5 stars, despite describing the song as a "New wave music|New Wave-y club single," says the supposedly rebellious "attention-grabbing" lyrics are "a Vanilla sex|vanilla recounting of her lesbian|chick-on-chick exploits" and that this "acting out" is "just to get a dude's attention."Frehsee, Nicole (2008). 
Sal Cinquemani of ''Slant Magazine'' wrote, Perry's "lead single 'I Kissed a Girl' features a throbbing beat and an infectious, bi-curious hook (music)|hook, but its self-satisfied, in-your-face posturing rings phony in comparison to the expertly constructed ambiguities of 'Justify My Love' or practically anything in the first decade of Ani DiFranco's catalogue; it's like a tween version of DiFranco's tortured bisexual confession 'Light of Some Kind.'"Cinquemani, Sal (2008). 
 Popular reception 
The song was premiered on BBC Radio 1 in the United Kingdom|UK on July 21, 2008 on The Scott Mills Show. It was praised by many fans on their text lines and was made his record of the week. On July 23, 2008, "I Kissed a Girl" was added to the station's C-List, "The Playlist," being, "where most songs on daytime Radio 1 are selected from". The song has since made it to the station's more popular A-list.
Previous to its debut on Radio 1, it had been (and continues to be) on the playlist of some of the UK radio stations which are part of The One Network for a number of weeks. In addition it had received at least one play a week on BBC Radio 2 on its Saturday evening America’s Greatest Hits show hosted by Paul Gambaccini due to the song’s number status in the Billboard chart.

 Controversy 
The song gained a significant amount of 
While Haffner, who holds a degree in public health, believes Perry "obviously is using the whole issue of sexual orientation in a positive way, raising awareness, or she's doing it because it gets attention," AllMusic concludes that, "the problem is not with Katy's gender-bending, it's that her heart isn't in it; she's just using it to get her places, so she sinks to crass, craven depths." ''Slant Magazine'' agrees, saying, the song, "isn't problematic because it promotes homosexuality, but because its Cultural appropriation|appropriation of the Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|gay lifestyle exists for the sole purpose of garnering attention—both from Perry's boyfriend and her audience."

Adam Holz of ''PluggedinOnline'', a division of Focus on the Family (United States)|Focus on the Family, wrote an article entitled "A Tale of Two Katys"Holz, Adam (2008). 
In some areas of the world the song's bi-curious lyrics have kept it from reaching the Top 40 or to even be released at all. Though the ''Toronto Star'', of Canada, describes it as "a lesbian-friendly tune,"Infantry, Ashante. 
During her Washington concert at Warped Tour, Perry actually did kiss a girl from the audience.

In an August 2008 interview with the ''Daily Mail'', Perry's mother, Mary Hudson, who is an evangelical Christian preacher, was reported as saying that she disliked the song, stating: "It clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting..." However, Perry took to her official blog stating that her mother's supposed comments were completely fabricated, while also saying her parents love and support her and attend many of her shows.

Regarding the question of her own sexuality that the song has raised, Perry told Santa Barbara magazine (which featured her on the cover), "I like to kiss boys, but there is no doubt in my mind if Angelina Jolie or Gisele Bündchen came a callin', who wouldn't pucker up?"Aug./Sept. 2008 issue of Santa Barbara magazine
