The '''Pacific Ring of Fire''' is an arc around the Pacific Ocean where many volcanoes and earthquakes are formed.

About three quarters of the world's dormant volcanos and active volcanos are here. The ring is 40,000km long, and there are 452 volcanoes.

About 90%. 

The Ring of Fire is a direct result of plate tectonics and the movement and collisions of crustal plates.
