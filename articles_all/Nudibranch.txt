The taxonomy of the Nudibranchia is still under investigation.
Meanwhile, the nudibranchs are commonly divided into two main types, ''dorid'' nudibranchs and ''aeolid'' or ''eolid'' nudibranchs: Hans Bertsch,  Dorids are recognised by the branchial (gill) plume, which forms a cluster on the posterior part of the body, around the anus.  
 Aeolids have ''cerata'' on their backs, instead of the branchial plume. Some are hosts to zooxanthellae, which are endosymbiont brown dinoflagellates of the genus ''Symbiodinium''.
