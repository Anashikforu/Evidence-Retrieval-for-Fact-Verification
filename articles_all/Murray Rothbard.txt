'''Murray Newton Rothbard''' (March 2, 1926 – January 7, 1995) was an American economics|economist and writer.  He helped make the Austrian School of economics popular in the United States.

Rothbard helped to create modern libertarianism, a politics|political belief in less government and more personal freedom. He founded a form of Free market|free-market anarchism which he called "anarcho-capitalism". Rothbard believed society should organise itself, and he didn't like Command economy|central planning.Noce, Jaime E. & Miskelly, Matthew 2002. ''Anarchism: political theories for students''.  Gale. p7

Rothbard wrote over twenty books and was an important central figure in the American libertarian movement.Ronald Hamowy, Editor, ''The encyclopedia of libertarianism,'' 
 His ideas 
Rothbard advocated the wikt:abolish|abolition of government control of society and the economy. He considered the monopoly force of government the greatest danger to liberty and the long-term well-being of the people. He called the state a "gang of thieves writ large — the most immoral, grasping and unscrupulous individuals in any society".
Rothbard thought that all services provided by monopoly governments could be provided more efficiently by the private sector. According to him, many regulations and laws passed "for the public interest" were self-interested power grabs by scheming government Bureaucracy|bureaucrats to make themselves look important. These schemes were not subject to Free market|market disciplines.

Government services were not efficient, and would get eliminated, if the services could be provided by competition in the private sector.
Rothbard was equally condemning of big business working with government. Business elites, he thought, used government's monopoly power so as to influence laws and regulatory policy to help themselves at the expense of their competitive rivals.''For a new liberty'', Chapter 3

He argued that taxation was theft on a grand scale, backed by law. It was "a compulsory monopoly of force" which prevented the more efficient voluntary procurement of defense and judicial services from competing suppliers.
