'''Karel Willem Frederik Marie Doorman''' (April 23, 1889 in Utrecht (city)|Utrecht - February 28, 1942) was a The Netherlands|Dutch admiral (Dutch language|Dutch: ''schout-bij-nacht'') during World War II.

In 1942 he was made commander of the combined United States|American, United Kingdom|British, Netherlands|Dutch and Australian Fleet (ships)|fleet in the Dutch East Indies.

In February 1942, he led his fleet against a much stronger Japanese fleet in the Java Sea. This battle became a disaster for the Allies of World War II|Allies. Doorman became a hero in the Netherlands, partly of his last words to the fleet: "Ik val aan, volg mij!" (I am attacking, follow me). 

Karel Doorman died when his ship HNLMS De Ruyter|''De Ruyter'' (named after the famous Dutch Admiral Michiel de Ruyter) was hit by a torpedo and sank. There was enough time to escape, but Doorman rather went under with his ship, according to old tradition.
