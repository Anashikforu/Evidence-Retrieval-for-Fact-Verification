iPhone copying LG Prada
LG Electronics says that the iPhone's design was copied from the LG Prada.  Woo-Young Kwak, head of LG Mobile Handset R&D Center, said at a press conference:

“We think that Apple copied the LG Prada phone after it was shown in the iF Design Award and won the prize in September 2006.”
LG later claimed that Apple stole both the ideas and concept of the Prada phone.  A lawsuit by LG had been rumored prior to this announcement; however, LG has remained silent on whether or not they will file a lawsuit.
