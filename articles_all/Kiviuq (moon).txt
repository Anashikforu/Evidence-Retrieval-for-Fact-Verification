'''Kiviuq''' is a non-Sphere|spherical moon of Saturn_(planet)|Saturn. It was found by Brett J. Gladman in 2000, and given the designation '''S/2000&nbsp;S&nbsp;5'''.

It was named in 2003 after a "giant" of Inuit mythology. Kiviuq (also spelled Keeveeok, Qiviuq or Kivioq) is a legendary and heroic Inuk, a sort of Inuit Odysseus. He has lived very long (or has had several lives), has wandered and journeyed, living all sorts of adventures whose details depend on the story-teller's local tradition.

Kiviuq is about 16 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 11.1 million kilometers in 450 days. It is a member of the Saturn's Inuit group of satellites|Inuit group of non-spherical moons.

Kiviuq displays ''light-red'' colours and the infrared spectrum very similar to Siarnaq (moon)|Siarnaq and Paaliaq (moon)|Paaliaq, further supporting the thesis of a possible common origin of the Inuit group in the break-up of a bigger body.
