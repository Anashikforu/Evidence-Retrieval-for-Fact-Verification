image:Tektronix 475A oscilloscope.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A Tektronix model 475A portable analogue oscilloscope, typical of the late 1970s.
This dual-trace, dual-sweep instrument had a horizontal bandwidth of 250 Megahertz|MHz, a maximum vertical sensitivity of 5 Volt|mV per division, and maximum (unmagnified) horizontal sweep speed of 10 nanosecond|ns per division. The vertical controls are on the left with Channel 1 above and Channel 2 below. The horizontal sweep controls are on the right with the Main Trigger above and the Delayed Trigger below. The Cathode ray tube|CRT controls are below the screen. The metal loop to the lower right of the screen provided a calibration signal for voltage and current Test probe|probes.

An '''oscilloscope''' (sometimes abbreviated '''CRO''', for cathode ray oscilloscope, or commonly just '''scope''' or '''O-scope''') is a piece of electronic equipment that lets you see changes in signal voltage. For example, if you want to see the signal a small electronic timer was producing, you could connect it to an oscilloscope and see.  

Usually, it shows a two-dimensional graph of one or more electrical potential differences (vertical axis). These graphs are plotted with time or of some other voltage along horizontal axis.

 Description 


A typical oscilloscope is usually box shaped with a display screen, numerous input connectors, control knobs and buttons on the front panel.  
To aid measurement, a grid called the ''graticule'' is drawn on the face of the screen.  Each square in the graticule is known as a ''division''.
