A '''heat wave''' is a period of unusually warm or very hot weather, and may be accompanied by high humidity. "Heat wave" is not an exact term:  So a "heat wave" could mean a little warm weather, (like "several days as hot as summer, but in winter"), or temperatures so high they make history, (such as, "the hottest summer in a hundred years").
