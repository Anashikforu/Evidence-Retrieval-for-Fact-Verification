'''State Electoral District''' means an electorate in the Lower House or Legislative Assembly of Australian states and territories. Most state electoral districts (except Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania, which have multi-member electorates using a Single Transferable Vote|proportional voting method) send a single member to a state or territory's parliament using the Australian electoral system#Preferential voting|preferential method of voting. The size of a state electoral district depends on the Electoral Acts in the state and vary in size between them. At present, there are 407 state electoral districts in Australia.

State electoral districts do not apply to the Upper House, or Legislative Council, in the states which have one (New South Wales Legislative Council|New South Wales, South Australian Legislative Council|South Australia, Tasmanian Legislative Council|Tasmania, Victorian Legislative Council|Victoria and Western Australian Legislative Council|Western Australia). In New South Wales and South Australia, MLCs represent the entire state, in Tasmania they represent single-member districts, and in Victoria and Western Australia they represent a region formed by grouping electoral districts together.
