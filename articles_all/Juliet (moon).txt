'''Juliet''' is a closer moon to Uranus (planet)|Uranus. It was found from the images taken by ''Voyager 2'' on 1986-01-03, and was given the designation '''S/1986&nbsp;U&nbsp;2'''.

Juliet belongs to Portia Group of moons, which also includes Bianca (moon)|Bianca, Cressida (moon)|Cressida, Desdemona (moon)|Desdemona, portia (moon)|Portia, Rosalind (moon)|Rosalind, Cupid (moon)|Cupid, Belinda (moon)|Belinda and Perdita (moon)|Perdita. These moons have similar orbits and photometric properties. Unfortunately, other than its orbit, radius of  53&nbsp;km and geometric albedo of 0.08 almost nothing is known about it.

At the Voyager 2 images Juliet appears as a stretched object, the major axis pointing towards uranus (planet)|Uranus. The ratio of axises of the Juliet's prolate spheroid is 0.5 Â± 0.3, which is rather an extreme value. Its surface is grey in color.
