'''Nix''' is a non-Sphere|spherical Satellite (natural)|moon of Pluto. It was found along with Hydra (moon)|Hydra in June 2005 by the Hubble Space Telescope Pluto Companion Search Team.

The discovery images were taken on May 15, 2005 and May 18, 2005; the moons were independently found by Max J. Mutchler on June 15, 2005 and Andrew J. Steffl on August 15, 2005. The discoveries were announced on October 31, 2005, after confirmation from photographs archived in 2002. The moon were designated '''S/2005 P 1''' (Hydra) and '''S/2005 P 2''' (Nix).
The moon follows a circular orbit in the same plane as Charon (moon)|Charon. It takes 24.9 days to circle around Pluto.

Before its size was directly measured, the moon was calculated to have a diameter of between 46&nbsp;km, if its albedo|reflectivity is similar to Charon's 35%, and 137&nbsp;km, if it had a reflectivity of 4%, like the darkest Kuiper belt objects.  Nix is slightly fainter than Hydra (moon)|Hydra, suggesting that it is somewhat smaller in size.  In the discovery image, Nix is 6,300 times fainter than Pluto.Brightness Difference on 2005-05-15: (5th root of 100) ^ (Nix Apparent Magnitude|APmag 23.38 - Pluto APmag 13.87) = 6,368x

Early research appeared to show that Nix was reddish like Pluto and unlike the other moons,(
Nix was visited along with Pluto by the ''New Horizons'' mission in 2015.

The formal name "Nix", from the Greek goddess of darkness and night, and mother of Charon, was announced on June 21, 2006 on IAU Circular 8723,
