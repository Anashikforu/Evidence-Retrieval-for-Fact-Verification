'''nUbuntu''' or '''Network Ubuntu''' is a project to take the existing Ubuntu operating system and remaster it as a Live CD and Full Install with tools needed for penetration testing servers and Computer network|networks. The main idea is to keep Ubuntu's ease of use and mix it with popular penetration testing tools. Besides usage for network and server testing, nUbuntu will be made to be a desktop distribution for advanced Linux users. 

 Contents 
nUbuntu uses the light window manager Fluxbox. 

It includes some of the most used security programs for Linux, such as Wireshark, nmap, dSniff, and Ettercap (computing)|Ettercap.
