History
As a result of the WWE Brand Extension in 2002, the WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|WWE Women's Championship was made exclusive to the WWE Raw|Raw brand. Thereafter, only WWE Diva|Divas on the Raw brand were able to compete for the WWE Women's Championship, while the Divas on the WWE Friday Night SmackDown|SmackDown brand were unable to compete for a women's-exclusive championship. The ruling was, however, ignored on rare occasions as Melina Perez|Melina and Ashley Massaro|Ashley have been the only divas who were on the SmackDown brand to challenge for the title. This led to the creation of the WWE Divas Championship, which was announced on June 6, 2008 during an episode of ''SmackDown'' by Professional wrestling authority figures#General managers 2|SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero.

At WrestleMania 32 on April 3, 2016, Amy Dumas|Lita announced that a new WWE Women's Championship would be created. In the process, the Divas Championship would be retired.
