The '''Niederschlesischer Oberlausitzkreis''' () was the easternmost ''Kreis'' (district) of the Free State of Saxony and Germany. It ended in 2008.

The urban district Görlitz is in the east, at the boundary to Poland. In July 2008 Görlitz stopped being an independent city, and became part of the districts of Niederschlesischer Oberlausitzkreis and Löbau-Zittau.

 History 
The district was not part of Saxony before World War II. It was a part of German Silesia. When most of Silesia was given to Poland after the war, the part of Silesia on the west bank of the Rive Neisse was made part of Saxony.

The Niederschlesischer Oberlausitz district was formed in 1994 by joining the previous districts Niesky and Weißwasser, and most part of the district Görlitz.
