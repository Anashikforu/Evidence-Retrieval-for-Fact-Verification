 Alternate definitions of  

There are many different ways to define , was trying to solve the problem:

: \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n.

In other words, there is a number that the expression \left(1+\tfrac{1}{n}\right)^n approaches as ''n'' becomes larger. This number is .

Another definition is to find the solution of the following formula:

:2+\cfrac{2}{2+\cfrac{3}{3+\cfrac{4}{4+\cfrac{5}{5+\cfrac{6}{\ddots\,}}}}}
