The main A38 road goes through Bromsgrove. The M5 motorway passes by the west side of the town. The M42 motorway starts at the north of the town.

Bromsgrove train station is in the south of the town. The station is at the bottom of the "Lickey Incline".  The Lickey Incline is the steepest hill for trains in Britain. An extra locomotive has to help push heavy freight trains up the hill. There are many passenger trains to Birmingham, Worcester and Hereford. There is a plan to build a new, better train station in Bromsgrove. The new station will cost about £10 million to £12 million.

There is also a bus station in the town centre. Buses travel from the bus station to many places in Worcestershire and the West Midlands (county)|West Midlands.
