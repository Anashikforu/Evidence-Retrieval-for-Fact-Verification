'''Apostasy in Islam''' is when a follower of Islam tries to change their religion. When someone tries to reject their religion, this is called apostasy. There are different cases to be handled:
 The follower of Islam must be an adult, the rules usually do not apply to children.
 The follower of Islam must be sane.  Insane people cannot make decisions.
 The follower must change their religion because they want to.  Being forced to change their religion is not apostasy.
