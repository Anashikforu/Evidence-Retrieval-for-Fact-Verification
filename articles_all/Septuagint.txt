Teacher's Edition-The Holy Bible).jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Septuagint:  A column of uncial text from 1 Esdras in the ''Codex Vaticanus'', the basis of Sir Lancelot Charles Lee Brenton's Greek edition and Brenton's English Translation of the Septuagint|English translation.
The original '''Septuagint''' (often referred to ''LXX'') was a translation of the Torah, the five books of Moses from the Hebrew Bible into the Greek language. It was done between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC in Alexandria. It was the first translations of the Hebrew Bible. After 350 years, the Church translated all the books of the Old Testament, and it also has books that Roman Catholic Church|Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians call the deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanon. These books are called Apocrypha by Protestants because they do not think these books are sacred.

An ancient tradition says that 70 Judaism|Jewish scholars were in a different room when they translated the Torah from Hebrew language|Hebrew into Greek, yet they all wrote down exactly the same text. People thought this was a miracle. The Latin language word for "70" is ''septuaginta'', and the word "Septuagint" comes from that. Another way to write "70" is "LXX" which is why writers sometimes use that as a short name for Septuagint.

The Septuagint was used as the starting point for some later translations of the Bible.
