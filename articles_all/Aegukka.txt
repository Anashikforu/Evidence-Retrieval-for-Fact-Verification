"'''Aegukka'''", Korean language|Korean for "'''Patriotic Song'''", is North Korea's national anthem. To celebrate the country's independence from Imperialism|imperial Japan, it was written by Pak Se-yong and composed by Kim Won-gyun, then it was adopted in 1947 shortly after.
It should not be confused with Aegukga|South Korea's anthem, which has the same name but uses a different romanisation scheme. It is sometimes also known by the first bit of the song, ''Achhimŭn pinnara'' (아침은 빛나라), meaning ''Let Morning Shine''.
