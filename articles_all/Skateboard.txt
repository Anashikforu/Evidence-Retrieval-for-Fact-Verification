Wider decks can be used for greater stability when transition or ramp skating. Skateboard decks are normally between 28 and 33&nbsp;inches long. The bottom of the deck can be printed with a design by the maker or it can be blank. And there are so many different 
The longboard, a common different kind of skateboard, has a longer deck. This is mostly ridden down hills or by the beach. The longboard was made by two surfers; Ben Whatson and Jonny Drapper. One of the first deck companies was called "Drapped" taken from Jonny's second name. "Old school" boards (those made in the 1970sâ€“80s) are mostly wider and often have only one kicktail. Different kinds of the 1970s often have little or no wikt:concavity|concavity, whereas 1980s models have deeper concavities and steeper kicktails.
