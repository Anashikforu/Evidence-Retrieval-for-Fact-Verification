'''Baked Alaska''' is a dessert made of ice cream on top of slices of sponge cake or Christmas pudding and covered with meringue. The whole dessert is then Baking|baked in a very hot oven for just long enough to cook the meringue.  The meringue is a good Thermal insulation|insulator, and the short cooking time prevents the heat from getting through to the ice cream.

Its name, but not the recipe, was made at Delmonico's Restaurant in 1867 to honour the new United States|American territory of Alaska.

February 1 is Baked Alaska Day.

Variations
A slightly changed dessert called '''Bombe Alaska''' came from Noel, Alaska. Some rum|dark rum is splashed over the Baked Alaska, and the whole dessert is flamb√©ed while being served.
