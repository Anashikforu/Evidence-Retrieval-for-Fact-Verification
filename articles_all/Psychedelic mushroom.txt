'''Magic mushrooms''' or '''psychedelic mushrooms''' or '''Psilocybin mushrooms''' contain the alkaloid psilocybin, or similar  chemical compound|substances.

Psilocybin is a psychoactive drug|mind-altering chemical. It changes the brain to an altered state of mind, or a different state of consciousness. This can lead to effects like hallucinations or visions. They may be used for medical purposes to treat cluster headaches, obsessive-compulsive disorder,

''Psilocybe semilanceata'' is the classic example of a magic mushroom, but there are quite a few others. These fungi also have some species with psilocybin: ''Copelandia'', ''Gymnopilus'', ''Inocybe'', ''Mycena'', ''Panaeolus'', ''Pholiotina'', ''Pluteus''.

Psilocybin can kill in extremely high doses. The LD50|LD50 of psilocybin is 280&nbsp;mg/kg for rats, this is about 1.5 times that of caffeine. In normal psychedelic mushrooms, psilocybin makes up about 1% of their weight. Therefore, nearly 1.7 kilograms of dried mushrooms, or 17 kilograms of fresh mushrooms, would be required for a 60&nbsp;kg person to reach the 280&nbsp;mg/kg LD50 rate of rats.

Psilocybin mushrooms have probably been used since Prehistory|prehistoric times. They may be seen in rock art.

The function of compounds like this in nature is they reduce the likelihood of the mushroom being eaten before its spores have been scattered. It is a defence against herbivory.
