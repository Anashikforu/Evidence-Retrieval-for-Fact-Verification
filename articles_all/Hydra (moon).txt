'''Hydra''' is the farthest moon of Pluto. It was found along with Nix (moon)|Nix in June, 2005 by the Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble Space Telescope's Pluto Companion Search Team, which is composed of Hal A. Weaver, Alan Stern, Max J. Mutchler, Andrew J. Steffl, Marc W. Buie, William J. Merline, John R. Spencer, Eliot F. Young, and Leslie A. Young. The discovery images were taken on May 15, 2005 and May 18, 2005; the moons were independently found by Max J. Mutchler on June 15, 2005 and Andrew J. Steffl on August 15, 2005. The discoveries were announced on October 31, 2005, after confirmation by precovery|precoveries from 2002. The moons were provisionally provisional designation in astronomy|designated '''S/2005 P 1''' (Hydra) and '''S/2005 P 2''' (Nix).
The moon orbits the barycenter of the system in the same plane as Charon (moon)|Charon and Nix, at a distance of about 65,000&nbsp;km. Unlike other moons of Pluto, its orbit is only nearly circular; its eccentricity of 0.0052 is small, but significantly non-zero. Its orbital period of 38.2 days.

Although its size has not been directly measured, calculations based on its brightness give it a diameter of between 61&nbsp;km, if its albedo|reflectivity is similar to Charon's 35 percent, and about 167&nbsp;km, if it has a reflectivity of 4 percent like the darkest Kuiper belt objects (KBOs).  At the time of discovery, Hydra was about 25 percent brighter than its sister moon Nix, which led to the assumption that its diameter was some 10 percent bigger. (
Hydra was to be visited along with Pluto by the ''New Horizons'' mission in 2015.

The name ''Hydra'' was announced on June 21, 2006, in IAU Circular 8723,
