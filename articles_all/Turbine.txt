A '''turbine''' is an engine that turns fluid movement into energy. 

Simple '''turbines''' have a shaft with a blade on it. Moving fluids, such as water or air, push the blades so that they turn around with the shaft. The turning movement is most often used to turn a generator. Early turbine examples are windmills and water wheels. Turbine blades can also be turned to move a fluid. This is how simple propeller airplanes work.
