The '''Ecdysozoa''' (including Cycloneuralia) are a group of protostome animal phyla. This is a taxon above the level of phylum. It includes the Arthropoda (insects and crustaceans), Nematoda, and several smaller phyla. 

They were first defined in 1997, based mainly on phylogenetic trees taken from 18S ribosomal RNA genes. 
The group is also supported by Morphology (biology)|morphological characters, and includes all animals that shed their exoskeleton (see ecdysis).
