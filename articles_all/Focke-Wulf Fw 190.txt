The '''Fw 190''' was a Germany|German fighter aircraft made by Focke-Wulf during World War II. It first flew in 1939 and was introduced in 1941. Even though it was not sleek, it could still go 408&nbsp;miles per hour (653&nbsp;kilometers per hour).

In 1942, Luftwaffe pilot Armin Faber landed by accident at a United Kingdom|British airfield. They were then able to find out things about the aircraft.

The FW 190 was 29&nbsp;feet (8.84&nbsp;meters) long, had a wingspan of 34&nbsp;feet 5.5&nbsp;inches (10.49&nbsp;meters), was 13&nbsp;feet (3.96&nbsp;meters) high, weighed 7,055&nbsp;pounds (3,200 kilograms) empty and 10,800&nbsp;pounds (4,900 kilograms) operational. It could go 408&nbsp;miles per hour (653&nbsp;kilometers per hour), could fly up to 37,400&nbsp;feet (11,410&nbsp;meters), and could go 560&nbsp;miles (900&nbsp;kilometers) without refueling.

FW 109 was 1500 kg heavier than Bf 109. It was also faster (FW 190 A-8 was 16 kph faster than Bf 109 G-6) but it didn't climb as fast as Bf 109 (at 15 m/s compared to 17 m/s of Bf 109). FW 190 was much better armed than Bf 109 - it had 2 machine guns above the engine and four cannons in the wings. Bf 109 had only one cannon and two machine guns.
