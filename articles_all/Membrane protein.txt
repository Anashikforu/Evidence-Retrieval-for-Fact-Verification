A '''membrane protein''' is a protein molecule that is attached to, or associated with the cell membrane|membrane of a cell (biology)|cell or an organelle.

20–30% of all genes in genomes code for membrane proteins.Krogh A. ''et al'' 2001. Predicting transmembrane protein topology with a hidden markov model: application to complete genomes. ''Journal of Molecular Biology'' '''305''' (3): 567–580. 
Function
Membrane proteins perform a variety of functions vital to the survival of organisms:Almén M. ''et al'' 2009. Mapping the human membrane proteome: a majority of the human membrane proteins can be classified according to function and evolutionary origin. ''BMC Biology'' '''7''': 50.  Membrane receptor proteins relay signals between the cell's internal and external environments.
 Membrane transport proteins move molecules and ions across the membrane.
 Membrane enzymes have many activities.
 Cell adhesion molecules allow cells to identify each other and interact. For example, proteins involved in immune response.
