'''Silla'''

Silla was founded by King Park Hyeokgeose
In the last stage of Silla, the king and noblemen indulged in extravagance, and it provoked the people to rebellion. The later three kingdom period began as Gyeon Hwon founded a new country, later Baekje, succeeding the ancient Baekje, and Gung Ye built Taebong succeeding ancient Goguryeo. Silla could not withstand their growing force, and finally surrendered to Goryeo in 935 and collapsed.
