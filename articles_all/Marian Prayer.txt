'''Marian prayers''' or '''Marian devotions''' are acts of asking for the intercession of the Virgin Mary|Mary, the mother of Jesus. It is mainly something done by Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics but it is also used by Anglican|Anglo-Catholics. Marian prayer is not worship. It is asking Mary to pray, or intercede for you and/or other people. When asking for Mary's intercession, you are honouring her and not worshipping her. It is to ask her to help you communicate better with her son, Jesus. They do believe she was created perfect, or without sin. They ''are'' still following the second commandment, because they are not worshipping, only asking for intercession in their lives. Many novenas and prayers can be said in her honour. 
There are in fact many common ways in doing so but there is a simplistic yet symbolical prayer called the rosary, the reciting pray for the intervening of mother Mary. This is said in honour and praise of her as well as to ask of her help. Another example is yet commonly said during the rosary itself and is called the "hail holy queen".
