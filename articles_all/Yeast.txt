'''Yeast''' are microorganisms. They are single-celled  fungi. There are about 1,500 different species of yeast. Most reproduce asexual reproduction|asexually, by budding. Some use binary fission to reproduce asexually.

A particular species of yeast, '''''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''''', has been used for thousands of years. It is used for baking bread because the yeast makes carbon dioxide as a by-product of it eating sugar, which helps the bread rise (Leavening agent|leaven). Yeast is also used for making beer and other alcoholic drinks by a process known as fermentation. This process produces both Ethanol|ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide. Ethanol is also used as fuel, and to make other organic chemicals. 

Yeast can be used to make electricity.  Yeast is also a model organism for studying cell biology. Some yeasts can cause infections in humans (they are  pathogens).
