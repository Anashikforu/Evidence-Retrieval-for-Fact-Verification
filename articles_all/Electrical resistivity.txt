'''Electrical resistivity''' is a concept in electrical engineering. It is a measure of how much a material stops the flow of electric current through it. Most metals have very low electrical resistivity.

More precisely, "the resistivity of a material of conductor is the Electrical resistance|resistance of its unit area of cross section and per unit of its length" The International System of Units uses the ohm metre for measuring how much electrical resistivity there is. Electrical resistivity is the inverse of electrical conductivity. This term is more used for semiconductors and Insulator (electricity)|insulators.

The resistivity of a substance is equal to the resistance of a rod of that substance which is 1 metre long and 1 square metre in Cross section (geometry)|cross-section.  This can be a 1 cubic Metre cube. So we can also say that the resistivity of a substance is equal to he resistance between the opposite faces of a 1-metre cube of the substance. The resistivity of a substance does not depend on its length or thickness. It depends on the nature of the substance and temperature.
