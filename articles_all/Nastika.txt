'''Astika''' (Sanskrit: : "orthodox")  and '''Nastika''': ("heterodox") are technical terms in Hinduism used to classify Hindu philosophy|philosophical schools and persons, according to whether they accept the authority of the Vedas as supreme revealed scriptures, or not.pp. 82, 224-49. .

In non-technical usage, the term ''astika'' is sometimes loosely translated as "theist" while ''nastika'' is translated as "atheist".For 
The three main heterodox schools of Indian philosophy do not base their beliefs on Vedas|Vedic authority:

 Buddhism
 Jainism
 Charvaka

The use of the term ''nastika'' to describe Buddhism and Jainism in India is explained by Gavin Flood as follows:

At an early period, during the formation of the Upanishad|Upanişads and the rise of Buddhism and Jainism, we must envisage a common heritage of meditation and mental discipline practiced by renouncers with varying affiliations to non-orthodox (Veda-rejecting) and orthodox (Veda-accepting) traditions.... These schools such as Buddhism and Jainism are understandably regarded as heterodox (''nāstika'') by orthodox (''āstika'') Brahmanism.Flood, op. cit., p. 82.


The Tantra|Tantric traditions in Hinduism, have both ''astika'' and ''nastika'' lines; as   Banerji writes in "''Tantra in Bengal''":


Tantras are ... also divided as ''āstika'' or Vedic and ''nāstika'' or non-Vedic.  In accordance with the predominance of the deity the ''āstika'' works are again divided as Śākta, Śaiva, Saura, Gāṇapatya and Vaiṣṇava.Banerji, S. C. ''Tantra in Bengal''. Second Revised and Enlarged Edition. (Manohar: Delhi, 1992) .
