'''Flux of Pink Indians''' was politics|political punk rock|punk band. It was formed in Hertfordshire, England in 1980. Flux of Pink Indians was made up of Colin Latter (Singer|vocals), Derek Birkett (Bass guitar|bass), Kevin Hunter (guitar) and Martin Wilson (Drummer|drums). The band was originally called the Epileptics and later changed their name to Epi-X after complaints from the British Epilepsy Association. In 1981, the group signed on with the Crass recording label|label. They took on the organization's dedication to anarchist politics and punk abrasion. They issued their debut album ''Neu Smell'' soon after signing. With that album they got an Independent music|indie hit with ''Johnny Kidd''.

Upon creating their own label, Spiderleg, Flux of Pink Indians resurfaced in 1982 with the album ''Strive to Survive Causing Least Suffering Possible''. Not surprisingly, their 1983 follow-up ''The Fucking Cunts Treat Us Like Pricks'' was banned by many United Kingdom|British retailers. One Manchester indie record Shop|store which did carry the record was charged for displaying "obscene articles for publication for gain." A long time off followed before the group - now known as '''Flux''' - returned in 1986 with the largely Musical instrument|instrumental ''Uncarved Block''. They disbanded in 1987; Derek Birkett later Wikt:founder|founded the One Little Indian label.

Their latest Compact disc|CD came out in 2003.
