The '''WWE Diva Search''' was a competition held by the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) which ran from 2003 to 2007. The aim of the contest was to find a new WWE Diva, from the 2004 contest onwards the winner of the contest was offered a WWE Contract which was worth United States Dollar|$250,000.

Despite only one winner of the competition each year (excluding 2003) the WWE has signed multiple diva search contestants, including Candice Michelle, Taryn Terrell and many others.
