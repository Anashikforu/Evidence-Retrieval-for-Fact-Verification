The '''Primetime Emmy Awards''' are awards presented by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in recognition of excellence in United States|American primetime television programming. First awarded in 1949, they were originally referred to as just the "Emmy Awards" until the first Daytime Emmy Award ceremonies were held in the 1970s, and the word "primetime" was added to disambiguate between the two.
