'''Falkirk Football Club''' is a Scotland|Scottish professional Association football|football club currently playing in the Scottish Premier League.

 Stadium 
In the club's early years, a wide number of pitches and stadia were used. In 1885, the site of Brockville Park in Falkirk was leased, and there the club remained until the last day of the 2002-03 season. Due to Brockville's central location in the town, and the SPL's stringent stadium requirements, the dilapidated Brockville site, home of Falkirk for over 100 years, was no longer suitable for the club's ambitions. For season 2003-04, the club groundshared with Stenhousemuir F.C.|Stenhousemuir at Ochilview Park|Ochilview stadium on the outskirts of the town. At the start of 2004-05 they moved into their new purpose built stadium which meets SPL criteria. The ground currently consists of two stands with a third due to start in the coming months.

The old Brockville ground was demolished in 2003/2004 and the land is now home to a branch of the Wm Morrison Supermarkets|Morrisons supermarket, which has several items of Falkirk F.C. memorabilia on site, including a turnstile from the old ground.
