New for 2010 is the Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser Man of the match|Man of the Match award. Fans vote for the top player for each match in the World Cup tournament.

 Group Stage 
The first round was also called the '''Group stage'''. There were 32 teams in the first round of the World Cup. The teams were divided into eight groups with four teams in each group. The groups were named Group A through Group H.

Each team in a group played all the other teams in their group one time. That means there were six games in each group and 48 games in the first round. The top two teams from each group in this round advanced (were allowed to play) in the next round, named the '''#Round of 16|Round of 16'''.

The FIFA uses the following method to rank teams in the first round.
# The highest number of points in the group matches.
# The goal difference in the group matches.
# The goal difference is found by subtracting the number of goals against (GA) from the number of goals for (GF).
# The highest number of goals scored in the group matches.
# The highest number of points in the matches between the tied teams.
# The goal difference in the matches between the tied teams.
# The highest number of goals scored in matches between the tied teams.
# By the drawing of lots (a random selection) by the FIFA Organizing Committee.
