'''''Struthiomimus''''' was a long-legged, ostrich-like dinosaur of the ornithomimid family. 
It lived in what is now Alberta, Canada, during the Upper Cretaceous, about 75 to 65 million years ago.

Description
''Struthiomimus'' is known from several skeletons and skulls.

It differed from ''Ornithomimus'' only in proportions and details. It had a typical build and skeletal structure for an ornithomimid.. 

As with other ornithomimids, it had a small slender head on a long neck. The neck was about 40% of the length of the body in front of the hips. Its eyes were large and its jaws were toothless. Its vertebral column had ten neck vertebrae, thirteen back vertebrae, six hip vertebrae, and about thirty-five tail vertebrae. It ground food up in its gizzard, and may have been herbivorous or omnivorous.Barrett, Paul M 2005. The diet of ostrich dinosaurs (Theropoda: Ornithomimosauria). ''Palaeontology''. '''48''' (2): 347–358. The animals were quite common, which suggests they were herbivores or omnivores, rather than pure carnivores.Paul, Gregory S. 1988.
