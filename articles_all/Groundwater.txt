'''Groundwater''' (or '''ground water''') is water located in the voids of soil particles and pores of rocks as sub surface water. Groundwater starts as rain (or other precipitation), and flows under ground for long periods of time through aquifers. Groundwater flow returns to the surface again through springs and rivers. Groundwater is an important part of the water cycle.  Plants absorb groundwater to make their food by photosynthesis.

People bring groundwater to the surface by digging or drilling wells below the surface. They bring up water from the aquifer and use it for irrigation and other purposes. Some of the dissolved minerals in groundwater are important in the food making process of plants.  Rainwater is the main source of groundwater
