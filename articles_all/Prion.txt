A '''prion''' (pronounced ''pree-on)'' is an infectious protein. The word is short for "proteinaceous infectious particles". 

All known prion diseases in mammals affect the structure of the brain or other neuron|neural tissue. Right now, they cannot be treated and always end in death.

Prions cause many forms of encephalitis, or brain disease, such as prion disease|scrapie, chronic wasting disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) and Kuru (disease)|kuru. Prions work by changing the shape of proteins in the infected animals. While normal proteins have lots of alpha helix|alpha helices, or twisted parts, changed proteins have lots of beta sheets, or flat parts.

Because prions are proteins, and proteins cannot reproduce themselves, it is a mystery how prions work. A lot of molecular biology research is going on to find out how they reproduce themselves, with no clear result so far.
