The format of the Cricket World Cup has changed greatly over the course of its history. The first four tournaments were played by eight teams, divided into two groups of four. The top four teams from each group progressed to quarter-finals and semi-finals.

A new format was used for the 1999 Cricket World Cup|1999 and 2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 World Cups. The teams were split into two pools. The top three teams in each pool went into the '''Super 6'''. The "Super 6" teams played the three other teams that had made it through from the other group. The teams carried their points forward from the matches played against the other two who were in their group. The top four teams from the "Super 6" stage progressed to the semi-finals, with winners playing in the final.

The last format used in the 2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup, features 16 teams allocated into four groups of four. The top four teams from the "Super 8" round advance to the semi-finals. The winners of the semi-finals play in the final.

The top four teams from each group will proceed to the knock out stage playing quarter-finals. Winners of the quarter-finals will play semi-finals and the winning semi-finalists will play in the final.
