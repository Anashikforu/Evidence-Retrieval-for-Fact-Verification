'''Cunnilingus''' is when a man or another woman has oral sex with a woman. He (or she) licks her sex organs with his (or her) lips and tongue. The word comes from a Latin word for the vulva (''cunnus'') and from the Latin word for tongue (''lingua'').

The clitoris is the main part of the woman's sex organs that brings the most feeling. Often, a woman reaches an orgasm during cunnilingus.

In the past, some thought cunnilingus to be taboo (bad).Janell L. Carroll 2009. Sexuality now: embracing diversity. Cengage Learning. pp. 265â€“267.
