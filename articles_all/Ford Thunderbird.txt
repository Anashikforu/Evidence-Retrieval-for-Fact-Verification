The '''Ford Thunderbird''' is an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company starting in 1955. The Thunderbird was also known as the '''T-Bird'''. The car was often used in NASCAR races.

John Denver recorded a song in 1986 called "Along for the Ride", about the 1956 Thunderbird. The words and music were by Danny O'Keefe and Bill Braun. The Beach Boys had a big hit with the song "Fun Fun Fun" which also was about the Thunderbird.
