The taxonomy and systematics of the Sooty Barbthroat wikt:complex|complex has made much wikt:confusion|confusion. Some authors thought the Sooty Barbthroat to be a "melanistic variant" of the pale-tailed barbthroat (''T. leucurus'').

Not only that, but some suggest that the bronze-tailed barbthroat (''T. n. loehkeni'') should also be thought a valid species and have the doubtful Christina's barbthroat (''T. n. christinae'') as a subspecies. Freire's Sooty barbthroat (T. n. freirei) is wikt:average|average between the sooty and bronze-tailed barbthroats however, and thus its status needs to be more clear before the problem is fixed.
