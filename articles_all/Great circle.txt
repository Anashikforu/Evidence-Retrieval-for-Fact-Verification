A '''great circle''' is the largest possible circle that can be drawn on a sphere, one that divides the surface into equal halves, called hemispheres. It is a circle that has the same diameter as the sphere it was drawn on. These Curve|curves are geodesics in the sphere and all have the same circumference, that is, the length around of the circle.

There are an Infinity|infinite number of great circles that can be drawn on any perfect sphere. The longitude lines on a globe all form great circles that pass through the same two Point (geometry)|points (the North Pole and the South Pole). The Equator is another great circle.

Great Circles can be used to determine the shortest surface distance between two points on a sphere (or on the Earth).

A straight line from plane Euclidean geometry corresponds to a Great Circle in Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean spherical geometry.
