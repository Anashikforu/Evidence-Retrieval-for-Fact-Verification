The Bible is a collection of texts. These texts are usually called ''books''. There are different versions of the Bible. These differences come from the fact that certain religious communities include those parts they find important and leave out other parts they think are less important. A '''Biblical canon''' is a set of books of the Bible that a certain movement considers Scripture (that is, inspired by God).
