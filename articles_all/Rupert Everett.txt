Although he is sometimes described as bisexuality|bisexual, as opposed to homosexual, he described his heterosexual affairs during a radio show with Jonathan Ross as the result of adventurousness: "I was basically adventurous, I think I wanted to try everything".
Everett criticised the introduction of same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|same-sex marriage, claiming, "I find it personally beyond tragic that we want to ape this institution that is so clearly a disaster".
