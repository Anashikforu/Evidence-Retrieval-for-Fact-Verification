This is a '''list of tallest structures in the world''', past and present of any type. Most of the structures are television broadcasting masts.  There are also the taller tower-type structures (like the CN Tower) and the taller skyscraper|high rise buildings (like the Sears Tower). 

The list also includes some other structures like oil platforms, electricity|electrical towers, bridge towers, etc. List is organized by absolute height since it includes many different classes of structures.

This list includes quite a few masts. A Radio masts and towers|mast is a man-made support structure, commonly used on sailing ships as support for sails, or on land as radio masts and towers used to support telecommunication equipment such as antenna (radio)|radio antennas ("aerials" in the United Kingdom|UK).

Terminology
There is often ambiguity between the terms Radio masts and towers#Mast or tower?|''tower'' and ''mast''. A tower is a self-supporting or cantilevered structure, while a mast is held up by stays or guy-wire|guys.''See'' List of towers Both towers and masts have limited floor space and are non-building structures, as opposed to regular buildings which have greater floor space for occupancy. The terminology is further confused through misuse. Skyscrapers are often referred to as ''towers''''See'' List of tallest buildings in the world and some towers use the term ''mast''. Ironically, ''skyscraper'' has some etymology from references to high sailboat masts.

 List by height 
=Notes=
 A minimum height limit of 350 m (1,148&nbsp;ft) or 300&nbsp;m (984&nbsp;ft) for notable structures is used for practical purposes to keep the list to a reasonable length.
 Likely structures still missing from this list include masts used for the Russian navigation system Alpha (radio navigation)|RSDN-20.
 Nonbuilding structure|Structures no longer standing are in italics.
 For all structures the pinnacle height is given. So the height of skyscrapers may differ from the values at List of skyscrapers.
 Most of the taller masts are in the United States, where a prevalence of masts of around 2,000 foot (unit of length)|feet (610 m) in height is the result of special rules in that country limiting structures and objects taller than 2,063 feet (629 m).
 Structures under construction are included in main list if its current height is over 350 m (1,148&nbsp;ft).

For practical purposes to keep the list to a reasonable length this part of list contains only notable structures.
