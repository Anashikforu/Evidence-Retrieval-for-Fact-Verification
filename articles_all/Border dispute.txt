A '''border dispute''' is when two governments or more do not agree on the location of the border between their lands. An example is Pakistan and India over the territory of Kashmir and Kosovo which Serbia believe is theirs. An historical example is the Honey War between Iowa and Missouri.

Wars are sometimes fought over border disputes. Irredentism is often a border dispute.
