Dutch historian Isaac Titsingh brought the seven volumes of the book with him when he returned to Europe in 1797. He returned after twenty years in Asia.  Titsingh's French translation was published in 1834.Pouillon, François. (2008). 
This was the first major history of Japan to be published in the West. It was also the first history book by a Japanese writer to be published in Europe.
