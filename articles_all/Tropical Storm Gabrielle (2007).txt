 Storm history 

A dying cold front moved off the coast of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia on September 2 and left behind clouds and showers that moved slowly east. and by late on September 4, the
thunderstorms had gotten bigger east of the system's center. However, the area soon became better for the storm to strengthen.

The storm started to wikt:develop|develop, about halfway between North Carolina and Bermuda.

After becoming a subtropical cyclone, Gabrielle was in an area with cooler air to the north, dry air to the south and west, some wind shear, and cooler water temperatures along the storm's path. These conditions made it so the storm could not strengthen much. However, a curved line of thunderstorms formed in the storm's northern and western sections,

Wind shear slowly went down as the storm passed over the Gulf Stream, allowing strong thunderstorms to quickly form near the center,
