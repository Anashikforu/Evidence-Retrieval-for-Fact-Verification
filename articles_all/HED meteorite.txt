The '''HED meteorites''' are a group of achondrite meteorite types: ''Howardites''
 ''Eucrites''
 ''Diogenites''
 
These are all thought to have come from the crust of the asteroid 4 Vesta. Their differences are due to different geologic histories of the parent rock. Their crystallization ages are between 4.43 and 4.55 billion years ago, by their radionuclide|radioisotope ratios.
