In computer science, '''synchronization''' refers to one of two different but related concepts: synchronization of Process (computing)|processes, and synchronization of data. 

 '''Process synchronization''' refers to the idea that multiple processes are to link or handshake at a certain point, so as to reach an agreement or commit to a certain sequence of action. 
 '''Data synchronization''' refers to the idea of keeping multiple copies of a dataset in coherence (in-constancy) with one another, or to maintain data integrity. 

'''Process synchronization''' is commonly used to implement '''Data synchronization'''.
