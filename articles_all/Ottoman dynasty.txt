The '''Ottoman dynasty''' (or the '''Imperial House of Osman''') ruled the Ottoman Empire from 1299 to 1922. The dynasty began with Osman I, but it was not recognized until 1383 when Murad I declared himself sultan. The dynasty might have been known as Söğüt before 1383, but it was later renamed ''Osmanlı'' (Ottoman in English) in honor of Osman I.

The sultan was the sole ruler of the empire. The power often shifted to other officials, such as the Grand Vizier.
