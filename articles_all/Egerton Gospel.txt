The '''Egerton Gospel''' is a set of papurus|papyri that are now in the British Museum. The papyri have been dated to the 2nd century|second century. The text they contain may have been written 50-100 AD. It is one of the oldest known fragments of any gospel, or any codex. Soon after the British Museum acquired it in the summer of 1934, it was printed in 1935. It is also called '''the Unknown Gospel,''' as no ancient source makes reference to it, in addition to being entirely unknown before its publication.

The surviving fragments include four stories:
# a controversy similar to John 5:39-47 and 10:31-39;
# curing a leper similar to Matt 8:1-4, Mark 1:40-45, Luke 5:12-16 and Luke 17:11-14;
# a controversy about paying tribute to Caesar analogous to Matt 22:15-22, Mark 12:13-17, Luke 20:20-26;
# an incomplete account of a miracle on the Jordan River bank, perhaps carried out to illustrate  the parable about seeds growing miraculously.
The last story has no equivalent in canonical Gospels:
