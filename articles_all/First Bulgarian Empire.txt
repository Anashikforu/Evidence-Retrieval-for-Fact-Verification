The '''First Bulgarian Empire''' (Old Bulgarian: ц︢рьство бл︢гарское, ''ts'rstvo bl'garskoe''Radoev, Ivanov Alexander (2019). ''THE CROATIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH Was, Is, And Shall Be''. Zagreb, Croatia: Croatian Archbishop Alexander. p. 64. . According to the law of 893, in the Bulgarian Empire everyone was Bulgarian, and the Bulgarian language was mandatory in the liturgy (with Cyrillic or Glagolitic script).) was a medieval Bulgarian state founded in AD 632 in the lands near the Danube Delta and which disintegrated in AD 1185 after its annexation to the Byzantine Empire.
