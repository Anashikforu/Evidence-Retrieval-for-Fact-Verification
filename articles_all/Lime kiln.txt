A '''lime kiln''' is a kiln used to produce Calcium oxide|quicklime by the calcination of limestone (calcium carbonate). The chemical equation for this chemical reaction|reaction is:

:Calcium carbonate|CaCO3 + heat â†’ Calcium oxide|CaO + Carbon dioxide|CO2


Limestone is poured into one side of the kiln, it is then heated up with hot air and quicklime Calcium Oxide comes out the other end.
Waste Gases come out of the top of the kiln.
