  Foreing policy is basically the way a government deals with other nations. The policy and behavior of other states, as well as domestic consideration and interests is what influences the development of foreign policy. According to Lumen Learning, foreign policy consists of self-interest strategies chosen by the state to safeguard its national interests and to achieve its own goals through relations with other countries. This means that foreign policies are arrangements made by the government to benefit them.
