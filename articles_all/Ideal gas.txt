An '''ideal gas''' is a gas with particular characteristics. 
 The particles have no volume
 All collisions between particles are elastic collisions and lose no kinetic energy
 The particles neither electromagnetic|attract each other nor repel
 They have random movement

Ideal gases are hypothetical which means that they do not exist in their true form.

Equation
The Ideal gas law that relates the volume, pressure, temperature and number of particles in an ideal gas is:

PV=nRT

Where: 
 n = number of mole (unit)|moles of gas
 T = temperature in Kelvin|Kelvin (K)
 R = 8.314 joule|J⋅K−1⋅mole (unit)|mol−1, which is the gas constant|universal gas constant
 V = volume in Litre|Litres (L)
 P = pressure in Pascal (unit)|Pascals (Pa)
