'''Scottish Gaelic''' ('''Gàidhlig''', pronounced "Gah-lick") is a Celtic language. It is commonly called just '''Scots Gaelic''' in Scottish English. It is a sister language of Irish Gaelic and Manx Gaelic; all three are Goidelic languages. These are related to the Welsh language, Cornish language and the Breton language (these three are Brittonic or Brythonic languages).

 History 
In past times, the Scottish Gaelic was spoken across all of Scotland except for the Northern Islands (Orkney and Shetland).Orkney and Shetlands spoke Old Norse language|Old West Norse because they were so long part of the Norse overseas settlements. In the later part of the Middle Ages, the kings of Scotland began to speak Scottish English and looked down on the Scottish Gaelic. After the union of England and Scotland, the Scottish Gaelic was snubbed and looked down on even more, and Scottish English took over.

 Scottish Gaelic today 
Scottish Gaelic today is basically that of the Scottish Gaelic spoken in the Outer Hebrides and on Skye. Generally speaking, the Scottish Gaelic spoken across the Western Isles is similar enough to be classed as one major dialect group, but there is some regional variation.

A census in the United Kingdom in 2001 showed that a total of 58,652 (1.2% of the Scottish population aged over three years old) in Scotland could speak some amount of Scottish Gaelic at that time. Only the Western Isles of Scotland have more people who can speak the Scottish Gaelic than not (61% of the people here speak Scottish Gaelic). The place in Scotland with the biggest percentage of Scottish Gaelic speakers is a village called Barvas on the Isle of Lewis. There, 74.7% of the people there speak the Scottish Gaelic.

Children in Scotland do not have to learn Scottish Gaelic in schools, though it is becoming a more popular subject as Scottish Gaelic is an important part of their Scottish culture.

Scottish Gaelic is also used overseas. It is estimated that 1,000–2,000 in Nova Scotia, Canada can speak some Scottish Gaelic.
