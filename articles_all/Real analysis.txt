'''Real analysis''' is an area of mathematics that deals with sets and sequences of real numbers, as well as Function (mathematics)|functions of one or more real variables. It provides a rigorous logical foundation to calculus, the study of continuous change. 

As one of the main branches of mathematical analysis, it can be seen as the real-number counterpart of complex analysis, which deals with complex numbers. Many results in real analysis are special cases of results in complex analysis.
