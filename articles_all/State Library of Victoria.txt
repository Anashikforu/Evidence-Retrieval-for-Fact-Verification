History

In 1853 the decision to build a state library was the idea of the Governor of Victoria|Lieutenant-Governor Charles La Trobe and Redmond Barry|Sir Redmond Barry. A competition was held to choose a person to design the new building; local architect Joseph Reed (architect)|Joseph Reed, who later designed the Melbourne Town Hall and the Royal Exhibition Building, won the competition.

On 3 July 1854, the new Governor, Charles Hotham|Sir Charles Hotham, laid the foundation stone of both the new library and the University of Melbourne. The library opened in 1856, with a collection of 3,800 books chosen by Sir Redmond, the President of Trustees. Augustus H. Tulk, the first librarian, was started work three months after the opening.

The first reading room was the Queen's Reading Room, now called Queen's Hall, which opened in 1859. wikt:temporary|Temporary buildings built in 1866 for the Intercolonial Exhibition (1866)|Intercolonial Exhibition were used until 1909, when work began on a new building to mark the library's Jubilee. This new building was the famous Domed Reading Room, which opened in 1913, designed by Norman G. Peebles. 

Plans for the rebuilding were cut back as there was not enough money for the original design. A new building for the museum was built after World War 1, in a plain classical style.

The reading dome's original high windows were changed and covered in copper sheets in 1959 because water was getting into the building. 

The library was also home to the State's Art Gallery and Museum until the National Gallery of Victoria moved to St Kilda Road, Melbourne|St Kilda Road in the late 1960s. The new Melbourne Museum was built in the Carlton Gardens in the 1990s.

The library underwent a lot of rebuilding between 1990 and 2004, designed by architects Ancher Mortlock & Woolley. The project cost about Australian dollar|AU$200 million. The reading room closed in 1999 to allow for renovation, during which dome's windows were put back. The renamed La Trobe Reading Room reopened in 2003.

The rebuilt library includes a number of exhibition spaces which are used for the wikt:permanent|permanent exhibitions; ''The Mirror of the World: Books and Ideas '' and ''The Changing Face of Victoria''. there is also a display from the Pictures Collection in the Cowen Gallery.

The grassy lawn in front of the library's grand entrance on Swanston Street is a popular lunch-spot for the city's workers and students at the nearby RMIT University. When the library was built, there was a wooden picket fence around the building. In the 1870's a new wrought iron fence and gates were built. The space was opened when this fence was taken away in 1939. 

A number of statues are in the entrance area:
 A pair of bronze lions were at the front from the 1860s until 1937
