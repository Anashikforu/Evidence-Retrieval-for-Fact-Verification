'''''Megaraptor''''' was a large 26 feet (8 m) long late Cretaceous dinosaur. It had two large sickle-like claws on each hand. It was a lightly built biped, with a large head and sharp, serrated teeth in powerful jaws.

The first fossil of ''Megaraptor'' to be discovered was one of its claws. As they strongly resembled the claws seen in Dromeosaurs, it was thought that Megaraptor was a large member of that family.

It is now classified either as a allosauroid carnosaur, related to ''Neovenator'', or right over on the other side of the Theropoda as a tyrannosauroid coelurosaur.
