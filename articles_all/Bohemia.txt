'''Bohemia''' is one of the regions of the Czech Republic. Poland is to the north, Germany to the west, Austria to the south, and the Czech province of Moravia to the East. The capital city of Prague lies in Bohemia. 

Bohemia is well known for its glasswares (and other handicrafts), its beer, but also its cuisine.

In the Middle Ages Bohemia was sometimes an independent duchy or kingdom. In 1526 it came under control of the House of Habsburg. When Austria-Hungary was defeated in World War I Bohemia became part of Czechoslovakia.
