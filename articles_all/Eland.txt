The '''eland''' is the largest antelope. There are two species, both African. 

The '''common eland''', ''Taurotragus oryx'', is from East Africa and South Africa. The '''giant eland''', ''Taurotragus derbianus'', is found in Sudan, Central African Republic, Cameroon and Senegal  and West Africa.

The two species are rather similar in size: males range in size from .

Giant eland are alert and wary, making them difficult to approach and observe. They are gregarious, and migrate in small herds of twenty or so animals. Giant eland live in open forest and savannah where they eat grass, leaves, and branches. Common eland live in large herds. 

Observers have, as usual, found it difficult to measure their speed of running. Some claim they move quickly, running at over .Note: these figures are only rough or approximate figures Others claim elands are one of the slowest antelopes, or more.

When walking, tendon or joints in the eland's foreleg produce a sharp clicking sound, the cause of which is not known. The sound carries some distance and is a good indication of an approaching herd. Naturalists think it is a form of communication in elands.
