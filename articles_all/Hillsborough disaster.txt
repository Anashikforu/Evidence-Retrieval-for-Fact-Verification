The '''Hillsborough disaster''' happened on 15 April 1989. It happened at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. A wikt:stampede|stampede of people in the stadiums caused the deaths of 97 people (all Liverpool supporters). Another 766 people were injured. It happened during the FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool and Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest football clubs.

After the disaster, it was believed to be caused by the football fans. However, this turned out not to be true. A later investigation saw that the police were to blame. Ambulances were not able to reach the pitch where the stampede happened, which helped increase the number of people who died. There is a memorial at Hillsborough Stadium in memory of the people who died.

It is the worst disaster in British sporting history.

The newspaper ''The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun'' made an untrue headline, days after the disaster. In February 2017, Liverpool F.C. put a ban on ''The Sun'' journalists from entering their grounds in response to the coverage of Hillsborough by the newspaper.
