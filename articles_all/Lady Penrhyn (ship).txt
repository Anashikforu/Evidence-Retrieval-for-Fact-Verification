The '''''Lady Penrhyn''''' was one of six convict transport ships in the First Fleet. The First Fleet carried the convicts and soldiers to Australia to start a penal colony. The ships left England in May 1787 and arrived in Australia in January 1788. This was the start of European settlement of Australia. 

The ''Lady Penrhyn'' was a ship of 338 tons under the command of William Cropton Server.  

After the First Fleet trip, the ''Lady Penrhyn'' was under contract to work for the East India Company. She left Sydney on May 5, 1788 to go to China to pick up a load of tea. The ''Lady Penryhn'' got back to England in August 1789.
