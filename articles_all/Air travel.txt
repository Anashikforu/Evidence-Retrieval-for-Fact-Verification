'''Air travel''' is the process of going from place to place by any flying object, such as airplanes, helicopters, Balloon (aircraft)|balloons, or anything that can fly. 

Air travel has been a very long dream of human beings from the ancient age. People seeing birds flying tried to take flight in many ways. At the end of the 18th century they made balloons, and at the beginning of the 20th they made machines that could fly. Air travel has made travel much faster. Today we can think of going around the world in 24 hours, which was never possible with any other type of transport.

Today air travel is a normal way to travel, for pleasure, personal need or business. 

Air travel can be broadly put into two groups; domestic flights, and international flights. Air travel within a country are called domestic flights. Most countries have domestic airlines to provide this service. Air travel across the borders of countries are called international flights. Long distance air travel is mostly international.

On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Since then, daily life across the globe has changed. Air transport has remained one of the hardest-hit global industries since the very beginning of the crisis.
The impact of the COVID-19 crisis removed more than 1 billion passengers for the whole year 2020 compared to the projected baseline, representing a decline of 64.6% of global passenger traffic. Compared to 2019 level, the decline is recorded at 63.3%.
