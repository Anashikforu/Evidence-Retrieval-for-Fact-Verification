 The Flight 
= Going to and from space =
About 500,000 people viewed the flight of Apollo 17. A Saturn V rocket took flight from the Kennedy Space Center in America.
About two hours after leaving Earth the section with the people in it went away from the main rocket. The section with the people in it had two parts, the Apollo Command Module called ''America'' and the Apollo Lunar Module called ''Challenger''. ''America'' was the moon control space ship and ''Eagle'' was the moon-landing space ship. 3 days later the team entered Lunar Orbit (orbit around the moon). A day later the ''Challenger'' went away from ''America''. The ''Challenger'' landed safely on the moon with Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt inside.
