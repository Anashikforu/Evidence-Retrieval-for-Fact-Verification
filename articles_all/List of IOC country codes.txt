The International Olympic Committee ('''IOC''') uses three-letter wikt|abbreviation '''country codes''' to call each group of athletes that participate in the Olympic Games.Mallon, Bill and Ove Karlsson. 
Since 1952, the list of IOC country codes has changed as new countries were added.  Sometimes the names of countries were changed.  Some countries have had as many as four different codes.Mallon, p. 26.
