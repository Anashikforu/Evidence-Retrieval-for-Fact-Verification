'''Earth's mantle''' is the 1,800 mile (2,900 km) thick shell making up about 84% of Earth's volume. It is over the Earth's iron-rich Earth's core|core, which takes up about 15% of Earth's volume.

 The upper mantle 
Past episodes of melting and volcanism at the outer levels of the mantle have produced a very thin Crust (geology)|crust of crystallized melt products near the surface, where we live. The gases evolved during the melting of Earth's mantle have a large effect on the composition and size of Earth's atmosphere.  

= Uppermost mantle =
A thin Crust (geology)|crust, the lower part of the lithosphere, surrounds the mantle and is about 5 to 75&nbsp;km thick.

= Asthenosphere =
Below the lithosphere the upper mantle becomes notably more plastic. It is called the asthenosphere, and is composed of flowing rock in the state of plasticity, about 200&nbsp;km thick. 

 Lower mantle 
The lower mantle is much thicker than the upper mantle. It is made of magma, under great pressure, and so is thicker (higher viscosity) and flows less easily. The lower mantles temperature has a max of about 4,000 °C (7,000 °F). 

The chemical composition of the mantle is heavily biased towards three elements: oxygen 44.8% by weight; magnesium 22.8%; silicon 21.5%. Compounds are oxides: silica SiO2 46%; magnesium oxide MgO 37.8%.

 Place with no crust 
In 2007 a team of scientists on board the RRS James Cook went to an area of the Atlantic seafloor where the mantle has no crust covering. The anomaly is mid-way between the Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands and the Caribbean in the Atlantic Ocean, at or near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It is about three kilometres under the ocean surface and covers thousands of square kilometres.

Other such 'Oceanic Core Complexes' (OCCs) were found later. Many have active hydrothermal vents.
