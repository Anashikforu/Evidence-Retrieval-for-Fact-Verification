'''Lithium chloride''' is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is LiCl. It contains lithium and chloride ions.

Properties
Lithium chloride is a colorless solid. It makes a bright red color in a flame. It absorbs water, unlike other alkali metal chlorides.Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. . It also dissolves more easily in water than other alkali metal chlorides.

Preparation
Lithium chloride can be made by igniting lithium and chlorine, but it is wikt:difficult|difficult because the reaction is wikt:violent|violent. This makes the anhydrous (without water attached) form. Another way is mixing lithium oxide, lithium hydroxide, or lithium carbonate with hydrochloric acid. This makes the hydrate (water attached to the molecule). The hydrous form can be dried to the anhydrous form by heating it with hydrogen chloride gas.

Uses
Lithium chloride is used to make lithium metal. Lithium chloride is melted and electrolysis|electrolyzed. This makes liquid lithium metal. It is used to dry air. It is also used as a wikt:flux|flux for aluminium. It can be used in making organic chemistry|organic compounds. It can be used to color flames red.

Safety
Lithium chloride is somewhat toxic. It was going to be used as a salt substitute but people found that it is toxic. It affects the central nervous system.
