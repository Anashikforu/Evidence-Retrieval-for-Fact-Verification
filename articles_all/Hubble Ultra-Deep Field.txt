The '''Hubble Ultra Deep Field''',  or '''HUDF''', is an image of a small part of outer space|space in the direction of the constellation Fornax. 

It took more than 3 months to capture this image, from September 24, 2003 to January 16, 2004. It is the furthest image of the universe ever taken by humans.

The HUDF contains an about 10,000 galaxy|galaxies. The patch of sky where the galaxies are was chosen because it has few bright stars in the near-field. Although most of the targets visible in the Hubble image can also be seen at infrared wavelengths by ground-based telescopes, Hubble is the only instrument which can make observations of these distant targets at visible wavelengths. 

Southwest of Orion (constellation)|Orion in the Southern Hemisphere|Southern-Hemisphere constellation Fornax at right ascension 3h 32m 40.0s, declination -27° 47' 29" (J2000), the image covers 36.7 square minute of arc|arcminutes. away, and equal to roughly one thirteen-millionth of the total area of the sky. The image is such that the upper left corner points toward north (-46.4°) on the celestial sphere. The star near the center of the field is USNO-A2.0 0600-01400432 with apparent magnitude of 18.95.

In total, the image required 800 exposures taken over the course of 400 Hubble orbits around Earth. The total amount of exposure time was 11.3 days for the Advanced Camera for Surveys|ACS and 4.5 days for the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer|NICMOS.

 Later versions 
On September 25, 2012, NASA released a more refined version of the Ultra-Deep Field called the '''eXtreme Deep Field''' ('''XDF'''). The XDF reveals galaxies that span back 13.2 billion years in time, revealing a galaxy theorized to be formed only 450 million years after the big bang event. On June 3, 2014, NASA released the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field image composed of, for the first time, the full range of ultraviolet to near-infrared light.
