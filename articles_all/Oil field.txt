An '''oil field''' is a region with many oil wells extracting petroleum (oil) from below ground. Because the oil reservoirs usually extend over a large area, possibly several hundred kilometres across, the only way to completely exploitation|exploit the field is with many wells in different parts of the field. Other than wells, there may be pipelines to transport the oil elsewhere, and support buildings for the workers and for repairs.
