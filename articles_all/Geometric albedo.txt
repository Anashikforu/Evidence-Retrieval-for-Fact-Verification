The '''geometric albedo''' of an astronomical body is the ratio of its actual brightness at zero Phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle (i.e. as seen from the light source) to that of an ''idealized'' flat, fully reflecting, diffuse reflection|diffusively scattering (Lambertian) disk with the same cross-section.

The '''visual geometric albedo''' refers to the geometric albedo quantity when accounting for only electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum.
