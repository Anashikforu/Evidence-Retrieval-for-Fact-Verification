'''The CW Television Network''' ('''The CW''') is a television network in the United States launched at the beginning of the 2006–07 United States network television schedule|2006–2007 television season. It is a joint venture between CBS Corporation, the former owner of UPN|United Paramount Network (UPN), and Time Warner's Warner Bros., former majority owner of The WB Television Network. The "CW" name is derived from the first letter of the names of these corporations ('''C'''BS and '''W'''arner Bros.). According to its former President of Entertainment Dawn Ostroff, the network tries to "appeal to people 18 to 34-years-old".
The network started after its two predecessors, UPN and The WB, ceased independent operations on September 15 and September 17, 2006 respectively. The CW's first two nights of programming—Monday and Tuesday, September 18 and September 19, 2006—consisted of reruns and launch-related specials. The CW marked its formal launch date on Wednesday, September 20, 2006, with a two-hour season premiere of ''America's Next Top Model''.

The CW offers a mixture of programming that originated on both UPN and The WB along with its own original programs, mostly targeted towards women and young adults.
