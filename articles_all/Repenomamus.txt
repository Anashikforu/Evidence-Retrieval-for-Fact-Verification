'''''Repenomamus''''' is the largest known mammal from the Cretaceous period. Its fossil was found in Manchuria.

There is good evidence that it fed on dinosaurs. It is not known whether ''Repenomamus'' was a hunter or a scavenger.

 Life style 
''Repenomamus'' was carnivore|carnivorous.  A specimen of ''R. robustus'' has been discovered with the fragmentary skeleton of a juvenile ''Psittacosaurus'' preserved in its stomach. 

This is the strongest evidence that Mesozoic mammals fed on dinosaurs, though there were earlier indications of this.Elzanowski, Andrzej & Wellnhofer, Peter. 1993. Skull of ''Archaeornithoides'' from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia. ''American Journal of Science''. '''293'''-A-A, 235-252

The larger species, ''R. giganticus'', is the Largest mammals|largest mammal known from the Cretaceous. ''R. giganticus'' was more than 1 metre (39&nbsp;inches) long and weighed about 12–14&nbsp;kg (26–31&nbsp;lb). Its skull measures 16&nbsp;cm (6.25&nbsp;in) long, its body 52&nbsp;cm (20.5&nbsp;in), and the preserved part of its tail 36&nbsp;cm (14&nbsp;in).  

 Discovery 
The fossils were recovered from the lagerstätte of the Yixian Formation in the Liaoning Province of China, renowned for its extraordinarily well-preserved fossils of feathered dinosaurs. They have been dated to 130 million years ago, during the Lower Cretaceous period.

''Repenomamus'' is a genus of triconodonts, a group of mammaliaformes with no modern relatives.
