 Arrest 
In 1977, Polanski got in trouble with the law in California when he was caught having sex with a 13-year-old girl called Samantha Gailey (now Geimer). According to the press release, the Swiss authorities asked for copies of the proceedings that would justify the extradition. 
:''"The request (..) was rejected by the US Justice Department on 13 May 2010. In the circumstances, it was not possible to exclude with the necessary certainty that Roman Polanski had not already served the sentence imposed at the time and as a result, the extradition request was seriously flawed. Given the persistent doubts as to the precise facts of the case, the request had to be rejected."''

Polanski is still a fugitive (wanted by the police) in America. Bernard Kouchner, a French public official, has denounced the USA's extradition request as "sinister" because it came so long after the event.
