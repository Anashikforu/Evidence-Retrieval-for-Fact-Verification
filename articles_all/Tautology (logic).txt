:''A tautology can also be a figure of speech''
In propositional logic, a '''tautology''' (from the Greek language|Greek word ταυτολογία) is a propositional formula that is always true, and is sometimes denoted by the symbol \top (a symbol also reserved for the truth value 'true').

A statement in logic is considered contingent if it is neither a tautology nor fallacy|false.

Some examples of tautologies in natural language include: 
 "I know that this is Wikipedia because I know that this is Wikipedia."
 "I am president of this club because I am the president of this club."
 "The first rule of the tautology club is the first rule of the tautology club."
These tautologies are sentences of the following form:
 A is true because A is true
Indeed, if A is not true, then A is not true, so the tautology is still true.
