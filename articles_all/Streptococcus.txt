'''''Streptococcus''''' is a genus of spherical Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes and the lactic acid bacteria group. They are cocci, meaning that they are shaped like sphere|spheres or circle|circles. Cell division|Cellular division occurs along a single axis in these bacteria, and thus they grow in chains or pairs, hence the name from Greek language|Greek στρεπτος ''streptos'', meaning easily bent or twisted, like a chain (twisted chain). Contrast this with Staphylococcus|staphylococci, which divide along multiple axes and generate grape-like clusters of cells. Streptococci are oxidase and catalase-negative, and many are facultative anaerobes.
