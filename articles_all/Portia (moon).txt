'''Portia''' is a closer moon to Uranus (planet)|Uranus. It was found from the images taken by ''Voyager 2'' on 1986-01-03, and was given the designation '''S/1986&nbsp;U&nbsp;1'''.

Portia is the second biggest closer moon of uranus (planet)|Uranus after puck (moon)|Puck. The Portian orbit, which lies inside Uranus' synchronous orbital radius, is slowly shrinking due to tidal deceleration. The moon will one day either break up into a planetary ring or hit Uranus.

It heads a group of moons called '''Portia Group''', which includes Bianca (moon)|Bianca, Cressida (moon)|Cressida, Desdemona (moon)|Desdemona, Juliet (moon)|Juliet, Rosalind (moon)|Rosalind, Cupid (moon)|Cupid, Belinda (moon)|Belinda and Perdita (moon)|Perdita. These moons have similar orbits and photometric properties.

Little is known about Portia beyond its size of about 140&nbsp;km, orbit, and geometric albedo of about 0.08.

In the Voyager 2 images, Portia appears as a stretched object whose major axis points towards uranus (planet)|Uranus. The ratio of axises of the Portia's prolate spheroid is 0.8 Â± 0.1. Its surface is grey in color. Observations with Hubble Space Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water ice absorption features in the spectrum of Portia.
