When a piece of music is in a mode (music)|major key, the '''relative minor''' means the mode (music)|minor key which has the same key signature. It can be found by taking the sixth note (music)|note of the first scale (music)|scale and playing a minor scale starting on that note. For example: in C major the sixth note is an A. Therefore, A minor is the relative minor of C major (C major and A minor share the same key signature: no sharps or flats).
C major is called the '''relative major''' of A minor.
