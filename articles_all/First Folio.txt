The '''First Folio''' is the common name for the first collection of William Shakespeare's plays. It was published in 1623. Its title is '''Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories, & Tragedies'''.  The collection was assembled by Shakespeare's theatrical colleagues, John Heminges and Henry Condell.  

Four plays are missing: ''Pericles, Prince of Tyre'', ''The Two Noble Kinsman'', and the "lost plays" ''Cardenio'' and ''Love's Labours Won''. It is believed about 750 copies were originally published. Two hundred twenty-eight remain in existence. The Folger Library in Washington, D. C. holds the most copies at 82. Copies that arrive at auction realize prices in the millions.
