The '''peppered moth''' (''Biston betularia'') is a species of nocturnal|night-flying moth. They are often used by educators as an example of natural selection: see peppered moth evolution.

The caterpillars of the peppered moth mimic the form and also the colour of the twig they rest on. The caterpillars can sense the twigâ€™s colour with their skin and match their body colour to the background to protect themselves from predators.
