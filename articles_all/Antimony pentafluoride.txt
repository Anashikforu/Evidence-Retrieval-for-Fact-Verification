'''Antimony pentafluoride''', also known as '''antimony(V) fluoride''', is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SbF5. It has five antimony-fluorine chemical bond|bonds. The antimony is in its +5 oxidation state.

Properties
Antimony pentafluoride is a colorless thick liquid. It is a powerful oxidizing agent and very reactive. It can help fluorine to oxidation|oxidize oxygen. This is not normal as oxygen normally oxidizes other things; it does not get oxidized. It can make very strong acids when mixed with hydrofluoric acid. It was used in the first reaction that used fluorides to make fluorine.

Preparation
It is made by reacting antimony pentoxide or antimony pentachloride with hydrofluoric acid. It can also be made by reacting antimony trifluoride with fluorine. 

Uses
It is used to make very strong acids.

Safety
Antimony pentafluoride reacts with most chemical compounds. It is extremely corrosive.
