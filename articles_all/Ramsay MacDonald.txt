In 1886, he moved to London, where he became an accountant. On November 13, 1887, MacDonald witnessed Bloody Sunday, after which he published a pamphlet in the media.

 As Prime Minister 
The main achievement of the first MacDonald government was the realization by the British that Labor did not intend to carry out radical changes, but was ready to act for the common good. At the same time, due to lack of public support and a lack of seats in the House of Commons, Labor has not been able to do much of what it has said before - in particular, there has been no widespread nationalization and community service.
