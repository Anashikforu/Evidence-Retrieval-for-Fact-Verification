 Skates and stingrays 
Skates are a bit like stingrays (they are in the same group), but they are usually smaller with shorter, wikt:thick|thicker tails. There is also a difference: skates do not have stings. Instead, their tails are thicker, with small "thorns" along the edges. At the wikt:base|base of the tail is a set of extra fins.

Skates and rays are also different in the way the give wikt:birth|birth. Most rays are ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous (the eggs wikt:develop|develop inside a mother's body), but skates lay their egg (biology)|eggs. This means they are oviparous.
