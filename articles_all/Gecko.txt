'''Geckos''' are small to middle size Lizard|lizards. There are 1196 different kinds of geckos, mostly in the suborder '''Gekkota'''. They live in many warm countries and usually are awake during the night. Some kinds of geckos go into people's House|houses. ''Hemidactylus frenatus'' is the common house gecko. People are often happy to have them, because geckos eat many insects.

Unlike most lizards, geckos have voices. A gecko sounds a little like a bird or a frog. In some languages, these lizards have names that sound like their calls, for example, both English and Indonesian call one kind gecko (gek KO) and tokay (to-KAY). Another kind of gecko, with a different sound, is called chicak (CHEE chak).

Most geckos Oviparous animals|lay eggs, but some Viviparity|give birth to live young.

Geckos have no Eye|eyelids. Instead, they have a clear membrane (skin) over their eyes. They lick the membrane clean with their Tongue|tongues. Like most lizards, they can regenerate their tail if they need to. Their tail also helps them balance and store fat. Geckos also shed their skin, like many other reptiles. Geckos are also able to replace their teeth every few months.

Many kinds of geckos can walk on trees, walls, windows, and ceilings. Geckos' feet form a Molecule|molecular bond with the surface that they are walking on in order to "stick" to the surface. This force is called Van der Waals force|van der Waal's force.They can do this because they have special toe pads. A microscope can show that each toe pad is made of thousands of hair-like structures called setae. Each of these structures branches into many smaller ends called spatulae.
