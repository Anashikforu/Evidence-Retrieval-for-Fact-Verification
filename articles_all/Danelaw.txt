The '''Danelaw''' (from the Anglo-Saxon language|Old English ''Dena lagu'', Danish language|Danish: ''Danelagen'' ) is an 11th-century name for an area of northern and eastern England. This area was under the administration|administrative control of the Denmark|Danish Viking empire (or Danes, or Norsemen) from the late 9th century until the early 11th century.

As can be seen from the map, Danelaw at its height was ''about a third the territory of England''.

 Textbooks say correctly that the history left us with place-names which reflect the old languages.The place-name term to look for is "toponymy" or "toponymics", and English wiki has a page on ''Place name origins''.
