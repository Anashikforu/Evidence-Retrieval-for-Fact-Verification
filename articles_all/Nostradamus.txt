'''Michel de Nostredame''' (14 or 21 December 1503 â€“ 2 July 1566), also known as '''Nostradamus''', was a France|French apothecary (or pharmacist) and 
Most academics say that these associations between Nostradamus' quatrains and world events are the result of misinterpretations, or bad translations, that are so far-fetched that they are useless as a source of genuine prediction. What is more, no interpretation has yet managed to predict any event before it happened.Lemesurier, Peter, ''The Unknown Nostradamus'', 2003

Fake Nostradamus prophecies
Some people have written prophecies that were wrongly assumed to be by Nostradamus. For example, in 1997 a college student in Canada wrote an essay that included a fake English quatrain (a four-line verse) written in the same style that Nostradamus used in French. The quatrain ended up on the Internet, where it was soon assumed that it was a verse by Nostradamus himself predicting the events of 9/11. So many people e-mailed it to their friends, thinking that it was by Nostradamus, that the associated websites and discussion forums were soon overwhelmed.
