'''Nigga''' is a term derived from the racial slur "nigger". It is generally used by African-Americans (especially young adults), because other ethnic groups using it is considered offensive. The use for this word is for a good friend, it can also be defined as a substitute for "nigger" in a less serious tone.

Note that this version of the word does not use a "hard R."
