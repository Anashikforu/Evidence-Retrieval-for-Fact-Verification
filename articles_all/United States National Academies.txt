'''United States National Academies''' or '''National Academies''' comprising 
 ''National Academy of Sciences'' (NAS)
 ''National Academy of Engineering'' (NAE) 
 ''Institute of Medicine'' (IOM) 
 ''National Research Council'' (NRC)
serve collectively as the scientific national academy for the United States.  The NAS, NAE, and IOM are honorary membership organizations, with a total membership of over 6,000 scientists, engineers, and health professionals.  New members for each organization are elected annually by current members, based on their distinguished and continuing achievements in original research.  The NRC is called the "working arm" of the Academies, which serves to collect, analyze, and share information through experiment|studies and reports.

The National Academies produce independent recommendations and policy reports by enlisting top scientists, engineers, health professionals, and other experts (not limited to those in Academies membership) to address important scientific and technical problems. 

The National Academies do not perform original research; rather they provide independent advice.
