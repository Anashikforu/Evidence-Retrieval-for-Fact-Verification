This is a '''list of crossings of the River Thames''' including bridges, tunnels and Ferry|ferries. There are almost 214 bridges, over 20 tunnels, six :wikt:public|public ferries and one Ford (crossing)|ford. The list starts at the wikt:downstream|downstream (Estuary) end and follows the river wikt:upstream|upstream towards the start of the river.

A few of the crossings listed are public pedestrian crossings making use of walkways across canal lock|lock gates and bridges above or near-by weirs. Most of the other locks on the River Thames also have walkways across their lock gates and weirs, but these either do not fully cross the river, or are for the use of authorised people only, and are so are not listed.

Besides the ferry crossings listed, there are commuter boat services along the river in the city of London, and tourist boat services running both in London and upstream. Although the main purpose of these services is not to carry people across the river, it may be possible to use them to do so.
