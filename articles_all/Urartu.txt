Urartians and Armenians
The Urartians are the most easily identifiable ancestors of the Armenians.Redgate, A. E. (2000). ''The Armenians''. Oxford: Blackwell. p. 5. However, the most easily identifiable ancestors of the later Armenian nation are the Urartians.Frye, Richard N. (1984). ''The History of Ancient Iran''. Munich: C.H. Beck. p. 73. The real heirs of the Urartians, however, were neither the Scythians nor Medes but the Armenians. Urartu, who is believed to speak at least partially Proto-Armenian,Diakonoff, Igor M (1992).
