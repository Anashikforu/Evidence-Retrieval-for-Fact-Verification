The '''ideal gas law''' is the equation of a possible ideal gas, first made by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834. 

The state or amount of an amount of gas is found by using its pressure, volume, and temperature in the equation:

:\ pV = nRT   

where 
:\ p   is the absolute pressure of the gas,
:\ V   is the volume of the gas,
:\ n   is the number of Mole (unit)|moles of gas,
:\ R   is the :en:Gas_constant|universal gas constant,
:\ T   is the absolute temperature.
