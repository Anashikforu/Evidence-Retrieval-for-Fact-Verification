A '''reduced instruction set computing''' (acronym '''RISC''' pronounced ''risk''), represents a CPU design method to simplify instructions which "do less" but provide higher performance by making Instruction (computer science)|instructions execute very fast.

RISC was developed as an alternative to what is now known as Complex instruction set computer|CISC. However, there are CPU designs other than RISC and CISC. Some examples are VLIW, Minimal instruction set computer|MISC, OISC, massive parallel processing, systolic array, reconfigurable computing, and dataflow architecture.

The main feature of a RISC Central processing unit|processors is a small core logic which allows designers to increase the number of the Processor register|register set and increase internal parallelism using one of the following methods:
#Instruction level parallelism (ILP) which increases the rate at which instructions are executed within a CPU 
#Thread level parallelism (TLP)  which increases the number of Thread (computer science)|threads the CPU can execute "in-parallel".  

Other features, which are typically found in RISC architectures are:

 Uniform Instruction (computer science)|instruction format, using a single word with the opcode in the same bit positions in every instruction, requiring less Parsing|decoding.
 Similar Processor register|general purpose registers, allowing any register to be used by any method, simplifying compiler design. However most RISC CPUs have separate floating point registers.
 Simple addressing modes. Complex addressing performed via sequences of arithmetic and/or load-store operations.
 Few data types in hardware. Some CISCs have byte string (computer science)|string instructions, or support complex numbers, which are almost never found on a RISC.

Well known RISC Central processing unit|processors include DEC Alpha|Alpha, ARC International|ARC, ARM architecture|ARM, Atmel AVR|AVR, MIPS architecture|MIPS, PA-RISC, PIC microcontroller|PIC, Power Architecture (including PowerPC), SuperH, and SPARC.
