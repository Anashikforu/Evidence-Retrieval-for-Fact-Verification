Admins, please maintain this page by including links to all Wikipedia:Disambiguation|disambiguation templates and any redirects to them.

This list is used by MediaWiki to know what pages are disambiguation pages, and thus not articles. This is used by Special:Disambiguations to show any pages linking to disambig pages.
This list is also used by various bots.

Note: This page may be reformatted. Any links to Template:... will be treated as links to disambiguation templates.

 Set index article templates 
Please add any templates here that are WP:SETINDEX|set index article boxes. Note: Use parenthesis notation here instead of links, so that they can be automatically differentiated from the disambiguation templates.

Most tools and bots only want to know about disambig templates. But the interwiki bots consider set index articles to be "disambig similar", they allow interwiki links between set index articles here on the English Wikipedia and disambig pages on other Wikipedias. So the interwiki bots need to know about the set index templates.


 ((SIA)) and its redirect ((Sia))
 ((Given name))
 ((Mountainindex))
 ((Plant common name)) and its redirect ((Disambig-plants))
 ((Roadindex))
 ((Shipindex))
 ((Sportindex))
 ((Surname))

"Given name" and "Surname" perhaps aren't really set index article boxes, but the interwiki bots need to handle them the same way.
