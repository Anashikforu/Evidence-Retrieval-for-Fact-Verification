In mathematics, the '''identity element''' (or '''neutral element''') of a set is a special element of that set. It is special because if it is combined with another element of that set, it does not change the other element.

With addition, the identity element is 0, because adding 0 to some number does not change the number. With multiplication, it is 1. In a Group (mathematics)|group (an algebraic structure in mathematics), the identity element is sometimes denoted by the symbol e.
