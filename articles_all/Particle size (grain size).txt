'''Particle size''', also called '''grain size''', means the diameter of individual grains of sediment, or the lithification|lithified particles in clastic rocks. The term may also be used for other granular materials.Size ranges define limits of classes that are given names in the Wentworth scale (or Udden-Wentworth) used in the United States. The Krumbein ''phi'' (φ) scale, a modification of the Wentworth scale created by ''W. C. Krumbein'', (Krumbein & Sloss 1963) is a logarithmic scale computed by the equation: 
:\phi=-\log_2{D/Do}\,
where
:\phi is the Krumbein phi scale, and
:D is the diameter of the particle
:Do is a reference diameter, equal to 1 Millimetre|mm (to make the equation dimensionally consistent.)
This equation can be rearranged to find diameter using φ:
:D=Do \times 2^{-\phi}\,



In some schemes "gravel" is anything larger than sand (&gt;2.0 mm), and includes "granule", "pebble", "cobble", and "boulder" in the above table. In this scheme, "pebble" covers the size range 4 to 64 mm (−2 to −6 φ).
