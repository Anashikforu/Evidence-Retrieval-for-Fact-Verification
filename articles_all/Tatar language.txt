There was another Latin alphabet for Tatar called ''Yañalif''. It was used from 1928 to 1940, when it was replaced with Cyrillic by a Soviet law.

=Arabic=
There have been two Arabic alphabets used to write Tatar: ''İske imlâ'' and ''Yaña imlâ''. ''İske imlâ'' is the older of the two and was used until 1920, when it was changed to become ''Yaña imlâ'' and remained in use until it was replaced by the Latin ''Yañalif'' alphabet. However, Tatars in China still use ''İske imlâ''.

Since 2012, it is possible for people and organizations to write to the Tatarstan government in either the Latin or Arabic scripts, but the government has to answer in Cyrillic.
