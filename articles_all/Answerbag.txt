Can anybody solve this problem?
A cylindrical tank filled with molten salt now considering the case half of the tank(top) is at temperature of 873K and bottom half is at 573K.
The dimensions of tank is given as (D = 3 m & H = 6 m). Let's assume there is no fluid flow or mixing hence heat transfer only by conduction.
How the temperature varies within the body w.r.t. time?
Assume density= 1803.8 kg/m3 , Cp = 1520.4 J/kgK and K = 0.45 W/m-K
