The Saar river is born at the foot of Mont Donon, the highest peak of the northern Vosges Mountains. It flows first for about  from its confluence with the Blies, between the towns of Sarreguemines and Saarbr端cken and goes into German territory.

Then the river flows about  through the Rhineland-Palatinate and, finally, flows into the Moselle at Konz between Trier and the Luxembourg border.

=Upper Saar=
The ''Sarre Rouge'' (Red Saar) and ''Sarre Blanche'' (White Saar) are considered as the two River source|source rivers of the Saar.

The Red and the White Saar have their sources on Donon, less than ), south of Sarrebourg.Because SANDRE, the French official organism, considers the White Saar as the upper part of the Saar river, the Red Saar is considered a tributary of the White Saar - Saar river.

The Saar river, and its two source rivers, flow first through the Moselle department, in the Lorraine region; then, for a short distance, flow through the Bas-Rhin department, in the Grand Est region. From Sarrealbe to Sarreguemines, the Saar flows along the border with Germany. At Sarreguemines, the Blies river, the largest tributary of the Saar, flows into the Saar and its Discharge (hydrology)|discharge rises from 20.9 m続/s to 41.5 m続/s.

=Middle and lower Saar=
From Sarreguemines, the Saar is :en:wikt:navigable|navigable (it is deep, wide and slow enough for a ship to pass). Then the Saar gets into German territory forming a narrow valley through the western Rhenish Massif. At its beginning in this region, it forms the famous '''Saar loop''' (German language|German: ''Saarschleife'') at Mettlach.

After 246&nbsp;km (129&nbsp;km in France, and 117&nbsp;km in Germany) the Saar flows into the Moselle river at Konz (Rhineland-Palatinate) between Trier and the Luxembourg border.

Grapes, to produce wine, are grown along the lower Saar, mainly between Serrig and Konz.
