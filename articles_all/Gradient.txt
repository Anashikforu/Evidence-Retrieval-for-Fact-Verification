In vector calculus, the '''gradient''' of a multivariate function measures how steep a curve is. On a graph of the Function (mathematics)|function, it is the slope of the tangent of that curve. More generally, it is a vector that points in the direction in which the function grows the fastest. Its coordinates are partial derivatives of that function. The gradient of a function ''f'' is often written as \nabla f or \operatorname{grad} f.
