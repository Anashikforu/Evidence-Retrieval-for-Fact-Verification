'''''Scelidosaurus''''' was an early type of herbivorous dinosaur. It was a thyreophoran, a lightly plated, herbivorous dinosaur about 4 metres long. It lived during the early  Jurassic, 208 to 194 million years ago. Its fossils have been found in England, Ireland,''BBC'' Family & Education. 
''Scelidosaurus'' has been called the earliest complete dinosaur.Norman, David 2001. ''Scelidosaurus'', the earliest complete dinosaur. In ''The armored dinosaurs'', pp 3-24. Bloomington: Indiana University Press.  This and related genera have been found on three continents.

It is one of the earliest and most basal of the armoured dinosaurs. A review by Serano had ''Scelidosaurus'' as the sister group (closest relative) to both the Stegosauria and Ankylosauria.Serano P.C. 1986. Phylogeny of the bird-hipped dinosaurs (Order Ornithischia). ''National Geographic Research'' '''2''', 234â€“256.

A full-grown ''Scelidosaurus'' was rather small, compared to some later dinosaurs. Its  length was about 4&nbsp;metres (13&nbsp;ft).Lambert D 1993. ''The ultimate dinosaur book''. Dorling Kindersley, New York, p110-113.  ''Scelidosaurus'' was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees, but its forefeet were as large as its hind feet, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture.

''Scelidosaurus'' and its Jurassic relatives were herbivorous. Other ornithischians had teeth capable of grinding plant material, but ''Scelidosaurus'' had smaller, less complex teeth. Its jaw could only do simple up-and-down movements. In this aspect, they resembled the stegosauridae|stegosaurids, which also had primitive teeth and simple jaws. Jacobson RJ. Dinosaur and vertebrate paleontology information. Retrieved 2007-02-11. The diet of ''Scelidosaurus'' was low-lying plants like Fern|ferns and cycads. Seaweed has also been suggested as a food. Grass did not evolve until the Cretaceous period.
