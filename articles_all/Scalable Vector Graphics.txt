'''Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)''' are a type of two dimensional picture that work on vectors, rather than pixels. This means that they can be easily be made bigger or smaller without losing any quality or becoming blurry. SVG is based on XML and created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

 History 
The W3C published SVG in September 2001. As of 2018 SVG is widely supported in all modern browsers.

The normal Filename extension is ''.svg'' and the MIME-Type is image/svg+xml.

 Structure 
SVG uses Extensible Markup Language (XML). So it has a definition of the document type.
