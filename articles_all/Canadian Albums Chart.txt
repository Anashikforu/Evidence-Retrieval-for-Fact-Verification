The '''Canadian Albums Chart''' is the official album sales chart in Canada.  It is compiled every Wednesday by U.S.-based music sales tracking company Nielsen Soundscan, and published every Thursday by ''Jam!'' Canadian Online Explorer|Canoe, along with its sister charts the Canadian Singles Chart and the Canadian Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems|BDS Airplay Chart.

The chart has 200 positions, however, ''Jam!'' only publishes the top 100 for the public. Unlike the case with its CD single equivalent (the Canadian Singles Chart), album sales are not declining as rapidly in Canada as CD singles are, and the Canadian Albums Chart remains the most reliable source for the most popular albums in Canada.
