'''''Gigantopithecus''''' was the largest primate that lived during the Pleistocene Era (1.8 million to 10,000 years ago) when large mammals ruled the Earth. ''Gigantopithecus'' is known to have lived in what is now southern China and Indochina (mainland Southeast Asia). He would have risen 3 meters (10 feet) high if he choose to stand up on only his hind legs, and probably weighed about 544 kg (1200 lbs). In comparison, gorillas stand only 152 to 182 centimeters (5 to 6 feet) tall and weighs about 136 to 195 kg (300 to 430 lbs), and the heaviest recorded was 183 centimeters (6 feet) tall and weighed 267 kg (589 lbs).
