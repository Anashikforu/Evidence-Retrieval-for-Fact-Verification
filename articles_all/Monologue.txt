A '''monologue''' is a long, uninterrupted Oratory|speech or poem by one person. The person may be speaking his or her thoughts aloud or directly addressing other persons, e.g. an audience, a character, reader, or inanimate object.

The term 'dramatic monologue' is used both for monologues in plays and for the Dramatic monologue|poetic genre.

Rant
A '''rant''' (also called '''harangue''' or '''declamation''') is a monologue that does not present a well-researched and calm argument; rather, it is typically an attack on an idea, a person, or an institution, and very often lacks Libel|proven claims.  

Some rants are used not to attack something, but to defend an individual, idea or organization. Rants of this type generally occur Quid pro quo|after the subject has been attacked by another individual or group.

Rants are used often in situations requiring monologue. Comedians, such as Lewis Black, Adam Carolla, and Rick Mercer, use rants as a way to get their message or punch-line across to the listening audience.

A rant can be used to Flaming (Internet)|flame members of an email group or electronic mailing list that are failing to reach a consensus on an issue.
