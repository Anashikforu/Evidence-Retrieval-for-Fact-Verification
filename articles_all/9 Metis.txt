'''9 Metis''' is one of the biggest Asteroid belt|main belt asteroids. It is made of silicates and metallic nickel-iron, and may be the core remnant of a big asteroid that was destroyed by an ancient collision.M. S. Kelley and M. J. Gaffey, ''9 Metis and 113 Amalthea: A Genetic Asteroid Pair'', Icarus Vol. 144, p. 27 (2000).

 Discovery and naming 

Metis was found by Andrew Graham (astronomer)|Andrew Graham on April 25, 1848; it was his only asteroid discovery.Graham, A.; 
 Characteristics 
Metis' direction of rotation is unknown at present.

Hubble space telescope images and lightcurve analyses are in agreement that Metis has a non-spherical stretched shape with one pointed and one broad end. Radar observations suggest the presence of a significant flat area,D. L. Mitchell et al., ''Radar Observations of Asteroids 7 Iris, 9 Metis, 12 Victoria, 216 Kleopatra, and 654 Zelinda'', Icarus Vol. 118, p. 105 (1995). in agreement with the shape model from lightcurves.

What the surface is made of has been estimated as 30-40% metal-bearing olivine and 60-70% Nickel|Ni-Iron|Fe metal.

Light curve data on Metis led to an assumption that it could have a moon. However, subsequent observations failed to confirm this.
 Occultations 
Metis has been seen to occultation|occult stars no less than 5 times.W. M. Kissling et al.,
