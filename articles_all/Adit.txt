An '''adit''' is a type of entrance to a mining|mine which is horizontal or nearly horizontal. Adits are usually built into the side of a hill or mountain, and often occur when coal or ore is located inside the mountain but above the local valley floor or coastal plain. The use of adits is generally called ''drift mining''.

An adit may be used for haulage typically by rail, drainage, ventilation or any combination thereof. Trackage is often removed for scrap value. Adits may contain wooden timbering or masonry to help protect against soil erosion.
