The '''Miami Seaquarium''' is an aquarium on Virginia Key, in Miami, Florida. The park has animals such as dolphins, whales, snakes, crocodiles, alligators, sharks, fish, parrots, turtles or sea turtles, etc. It has been open since 1955.

The main attraction is Lolita, the world's oldest captive orca. She is now the park's only orca. Animal rights activists have long argued that the tank does not meet federal minimum requirements (Animal_Welfare_Act_of_1966|Animal Welfare Act). The USDA has recently made statements in support of the activists' argument. However, Lolita is a special case.
