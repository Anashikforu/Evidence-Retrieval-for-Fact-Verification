There are three main groups of living ("crown group") tetrapods. Each group also includes many extinct groups:

;Amphibian|Amphibia : frogs and toads, salamander|newts and salamanders, and caecilians
;Sauropsida : birds and modern reptiles
;Synapsida : mammals

Snakes and other legless reptiles are tetrapods because they are evolved from ancestors who had four limbs. This is also true for caecilians and aquatic mammals.
