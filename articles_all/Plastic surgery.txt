'''Plastic surgery''' is a surgery that is done to change the way a person's body looks or works.

The two most common forms of plastic surgery are '''reconstruction''' (fixing body parts that have been damaged) and '''cosmetic''' (changing size shape or color of body parts to make them look better). An example of reconstructive plastic surgery is fixing a part of the body that has been burned. An example of cosmetic plastic surgery is a surgery called a "face-lift": pulling the skin of the face tight so that the client looks younger.
