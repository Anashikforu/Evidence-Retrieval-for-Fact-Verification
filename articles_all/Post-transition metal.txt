The Group 12 elements are sometimes included. Sometimes germanium and antimony are included, although they are normally considered metalloids. They normally have higher electronegativity|electronegativities than the transition metals. Their melting points are lower, too. They are generally softer than other metals. They include lead, tin and other softer metals.
