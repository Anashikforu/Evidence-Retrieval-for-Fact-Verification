'''Stygimoloch''' ''was a plant-eating dinosaur that had bony spikes and knobs on its skull. This bipedal dinosaur lived during the late Cretaceous|Cretaceous period, about 68 million to 65 million years ago.''

Stygimoloch ''are ornithischian dinosaurs that had thick, domed, spiked skulls. Pachycephalosaurs probably engaged in head-butting both as a defense and in intra-species rivalry.''

Stygimoloch fossils were first discovered in North America, specifically in Montana as well as Wisconsin. The first was discovered in Hell Creek,Montana and was named in 1983 by Peter M. Galton a British paleontologist and Hans-Dieter Sues a German paleontologist.
