'''Campagna''' is a small town in the region of Campania in Italy.

The town, located in a mountainous district, gradually lost importance in the 20th century. All its district offices have been moved to other cities since the 1930s, and the Diocese of Campagna merged with the Archdiocese of Salerno in 1973.

During World War II, Campagna was the site of an internment camp.
