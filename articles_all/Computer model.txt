A computer-based '''model''' is a computer program that is designed to simulation|simulate what might or what did happen in a situation. They are used in many ways including in astronomy, economics and sciences such as physics and biology. Computer models are used in fields such as earthquake performance simulation and making building model|models of buildings.

Well known areas which use computer models:
 Models of the atmosphere for weather forecasts and to predict climate change
 Aerodynamics via fluid dynamics simulation
 Agent-based modelling is used to simulate social interactions in artificial Intelligence

Computer modelling often uses numerical analysis to approximation|approximate the real solution of the problem. Simulation techniques are then used to get values. Numerical weather predictions are too inaccurate to give a good local prediction of the weather, so other methods are used to adjust them.
