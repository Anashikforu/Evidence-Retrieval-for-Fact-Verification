'''Follicle-stimulating hormone''' (abbreviated '''FSH''', sometimes called ''Follitropine'') is a glycoprotein and sex steroid. It is synthesised in the adeno hypophysis of pituitary gland. In females, it controls the synthesising process of progesteron and will cause the growth of ovarian follicle|follicles in the ovary|ovaries. In males, it will lead to the production of sperm. Other hormones control the release of FSH. Luteinizing hormone will cause ovulation in females, or the production of testosterone in males.

This hormone is made by the pituitary glands in the brain.
