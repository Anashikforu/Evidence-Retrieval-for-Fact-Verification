'''Godwin's Law''' (also known as '''Godwin's Rule of Nazi Analogies''') That means that as more people talk on the Internet for a longer time, it becomes more and more likely that someone will talk about Hitler or the Nazis.

In 2019, Bret Stephens demonstrated both the Streisand Effect and Godwin’s Law, by publishing a column in the ''New York Times'', where he compared his experience on Twitter to the plight of Jews under Hitler’s regime.
