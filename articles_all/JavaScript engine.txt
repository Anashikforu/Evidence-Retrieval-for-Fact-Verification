 Design 
JavaScript was originally created as a scripting language to allow web pages to have changing, or dynamic, elements. Early Javascript engines were created as Interpreter (computing)|interpreters, programs that simply read the script and execute the instructions without analyzing it any more.

As JavaScript started being used more an more as a General-purpose programming language|general-purpose language, execution speed, or how quickly the code is run, became more important for JavaScript engines. In response, many engines, such as V8 (Used in Google Chrome|Chrome and Chromium (web browser)|Chromium) and SpiderMonkey (used in Mozilla Firefox|Firefox), started using Just-In-Time Compilation. In this method, it starts by Compiler|compiling all of the code to optimized machine code, which is typically faster than interpretation, then running the result.
