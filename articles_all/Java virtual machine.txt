A '''Java virtual machine''' ('''JVM''') is a set of computer software programs and data structures which use a virtual machine model for the Execution (computing)|execution of other computer programs and Scripting language|scripts.  The model used by a '''JVM''' accepts a form of computer intermediate language commonly referred to as Java bytecode. 

'''Java virtual machines''' operate on Java bytecode, which is normally (but not necessarily) generated from Java (programming language)|Java source code; a JVM can also be used to implement programming languages other than Java. 

The '''JVM''' is an important component of the Java (programming language)#Platform|Java Platform. Because '''JVM'''s are available for many hardware and software platform (computing)|platforms, Java can be both middleware and a platform (computing)|platform in its own right â€“ hence the expression "write once, run anywhere." The use of the same bytecode for all platforms allows Java to be described as "compile once, run anywhere", as opposed to "write once, compile anywhere", which describes cross-platform compiled languages.
