'''Ngo Dinh Diem''' or '''Ngô Đình Diệm''' (; 3 January 1901&nbsp;– 2 November 1963) was the first President of South Vietnam.

Unlike most people in Vietnam, he was a Catholic. After he kept favoring people of his religion, he was overthrown and killed on 2 November 1963 by the South Việtnamese army during the Buddhist crisis. The army then set up a military dictatorship.
