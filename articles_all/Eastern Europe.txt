'''Eastern Europe''' is the eastern region of Europe. Originally, it referred to the countries that were under the influence of the Eastern Orthodox Church in Istanbul|Constantinople during the middle ages, which was in contrast to the West which referred to the countries under the influence of the Roman Catholic and later Protestant Churches. Later during the Cold War it meant the European countries that belonged to the Soviet Union, a definition that still persists today in these post-soviet states. Others describe Eastern Europe as a region of predominantly Slavic peoples|Slavic cultures, though other ethnic groups live there as well. Eastern Europe has a large Roma gypsy population.

According to the widest contemporary definitions - including those used by the United Nations|UN Statistics Division, several other UN organizations and EuroVoc (the multilingual thesaurus of the European Union|EU) - the following states are in Eastern Europe:

Since January 1993 some groups have changed their definitions of Eastern Europe. Although the list above is still the most popular and widely accepted definition of this region, some experts divide the region further into subsections. According to such theories: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia are in Central Europe (the western sections of Belarus and Ukraine are also sometimes listed as Central European) or East-Central Europe. Finally, the countries of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania and Slovenia are occasionally grouped with a number of other countries into Southern Europe, but more often referred to as Southeast (or Southeastern) Europe.
