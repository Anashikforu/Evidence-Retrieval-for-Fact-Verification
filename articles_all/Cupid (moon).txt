'''Cupid''' is an inner moon (which makes it one of the closer moons) of Uranus (planet)|Uranus. It was found by Mark Showalter and Jack J. Lissauer in 2003 using the Hubble Space Telescope. It was named after a character in William Shakespeare's play ''Timon of Athens''.

It is the smallest of the closer Uranian moons, estimated to be only about 18&nbsp;km in diameter. This and the dark surface made it too dim to be detected by the ''Voyager 2'' cameras during its Uranus flyby in 1986.

The orbit of Cupid is only 863&nbsp;km from the orbit of the bigger moon Belinda (moon)|Belinda. Amazingly, compared to Mab (moon)|Mab and Perdita (moon)|Perdita, the recently found Uranian moons, it does not seem to be perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed.

Following its discovery, Cupid was given the designation '''S/2003 U 2'''. It is also designated '''Uranus XXVII'''.

It should not be confused with the asteroid 763 Cupido.
