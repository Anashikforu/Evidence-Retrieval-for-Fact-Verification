'''Moment of inertia''' (I), also called "'''angular mass'''" (kgÂ·m2), is the inertia of a rotating body with respect to its rotation.

It is a rotating body's resistance to angular acceleration or deceleration, equal to the product of the mass and the square of its perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation.
