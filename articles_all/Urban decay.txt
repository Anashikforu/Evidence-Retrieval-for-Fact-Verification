'''Urban decay''' is the process whereby a city or area goes into conditions of disrepair or becomes decrepit or filled with blight. Urban decay involves white flight, population changes, depopulation, economic troubles, high local unemployment, higher than usual crime and political issues. Blight is associated with condemned homes, empty lots and deserted areas that oftentimes attract criminal activity.
