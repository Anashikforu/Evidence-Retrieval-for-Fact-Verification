In geometry, the '''radius''' of a circle or sphere, written as r,

''r'' = ''d'' รท 2

''d'' = 2 x ''r'' = ''r'' + ''r''

The relationship between the radius {\displaystyle r} and the circumference {\displaystyle c} of a circle is 
~c = 2\pi r.

The area {\displaystyle A} of a circle of radius 
{\displaystyle r} is 
{\displaystyle ~A = \pi r^2.}
