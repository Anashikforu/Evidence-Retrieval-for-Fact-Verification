'''Iry-Hor''' or '''Ro''' (as read by William Matthew Flinders Petrie|Petrie) was a Predynastic pharaoh of ancient Egypt, although some archaeologists are doubtful of his existence. He was most likely Ka (Pharaoh)|Ka's immediate predecessor. He ruled over Abydos, Egypt|Abydos and was buried in its local cemetery at Umm el-Qa'ab near Ka, Narmer and the First Dynasty kings.

If he existed, he would be the earliest documented person.
