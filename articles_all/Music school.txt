A '''music school''' or '''conservatoire''' teaches music in all its aspects. It may be called a college of music, or academy of music or conservatory (American English) or a conservatorium (Australian English).

Music schools exist at different levels: The term conservatory is often used for specialized university-grade schools that train people who want a career as a music artist, dance or theatre performer. These people then study  how to play musical instruments, singing, Composition (music)|composition, musicology, music history and music theory.

Several high schools also offer an education in music. In these high schools, the subjects are integrated into a normal school curriculum.

The third type of music school is independent of the other education a child or adults gets. These schools are often organised as associations, or they are run by a theatre. Pupils can learn how to sing, play an instrument, or be a dancer or actor in a theatre play, outside a context of regular schooling.
