A '''playground''' Having a playground can enhance your macadam surface and improve your kidâ€™s time in the playground.

The equipment may be made of metal, wood or plastic. The ground beneath the equipment will not be hard in case a child falls. It may be a rubber floor, or there may be woodchips or sand. 

Playgrounds give children a place for physical exercise.  This helps them get and keep physical fitness and be strong and healthy.  Daily exercise reduces the risks of obesity.
