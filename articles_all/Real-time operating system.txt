A '''real-time operating system''' ('''RTOS'''; commonly pronounced as "are-toss") is a Computer multitasking|multitasking operating system designed for real-time computing|real-time applications. Such applications include embedded systems, industrial robots, scientific research equipment and others.

An RTOS simplifies the creation of a real-time computing|real-time applications, but does not guarantee the final result will be real-time; this requires good Computer program|development of the software.

Real-time operating systems use specialized Scheduling (computing)|scheduling algorithms in order to provide the real-time computing|real-time Computer program|applications. An RTOS can respond more quickly and/or Predictability|predictably to an Event-driven programming|event than other operating systems.

The main features of an RTOS are minimal interrupt latency and a minimal thread switching latency.

The basic two designs for RTOS are:

 Event-driven (priority Scheduling (computing)|scheduling) designs: switch tasks only when an event of higher priority needs service, called Preemption (computing)|pre-emptive priority.
 Time-sharing designs: switch tasks on a clock interrupt, and on events, called Round-robin scheduling|round robin.

 Examples 
These are the best known, most widely used real-time operating systems. See List of real-time operating systems for a full list. Also, see List of operating systems for all types of operating systems.
<!-- Please do not add any more RTOS examples.
  Instead, add any and all entries to List of real-time operating systems.
  They do not need to be notable to be mentioned there.  Nor do they need their own article to be listed.
