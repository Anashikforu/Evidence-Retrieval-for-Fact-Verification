In computer network and computer science, '''digital bandwidth''' or just '''bandwidth''' means the amount of Information|data that can be sent from one point to another in a certain period of time. It is measured as a bit rate expressed in bits per second (bits/s) or multiples of it (kbit/s Mbit/s etc.) 

Digital bandwidth should not be confused with:
'''Network throughput''': which is the average rate of ''successful'' data transfer through a connection. 
'''Data transfer''': which is the quantity of data transferred over a given period of time.

 Bandwidth in web hosting 
In World Wide Web|web hosting, the term "bandwidth" is often used to describe the amount of data transferred to or from the website within a defined period of time. Another more specific phrase used for this meaning of '''bandwidth''' is '''monthly data transfer'''.

Web hosting companies often quote a '''monthly data transfer''' for a website, for example 500 gigabytes per month. If the total amount of data downloaded from the website in a particular month reaches this limit, the hosting company may shut off further public access to the site.

 Internet connections bandwidths 


=Broadband=
Sometimes, the word "broadband" is used to mean "high-speed", especially with high-speed internet connections.  "Broadband" means "wide band", and suggests high-speed.  However, the term is not clear;  "high-speed" is more clear. A dial-up telephone connection is most often thought to be low-speed, at less than 56,000 bit/s (bits per second). High-speed is usually 200,000 bit/s or faster. DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) or Cable modem connections are usually high-speed.
