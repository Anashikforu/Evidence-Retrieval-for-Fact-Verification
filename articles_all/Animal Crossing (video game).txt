Gameplay
The player moves into a village where everyone is an animal. Only the player is human. Only four people can move to the village and live in their own house. They have to pay money (called "bells") for the house, and when they did it the house will get bigger. Bells can be earned by fishing, catching insects, selling things and other ways. The players can buy the things they like from Tom Nook (a racoon who has got a shop in the village) and put them in their houses.

You can visit the villages of other players by using their Memory Card.
