The '''Atlantic Coast Conference''' (ACC) is one of the major college sports conferences in the United States. It was formed in 1953 by a group of seven colleges and university|universities that left the Southern Conference.

 Members 

The 15 schools in the conference are split into two groups—the Atlantic and Coastal Divisions—in American football|football and baseball. Notre Dame does not play football in the ACC; in that sport, it remains an "independent" school that does not play in a conference. However, it has agreed to play five of its 12 regular-season games each year against other ACC schools. Syracuse does not have a baseball team; Notre Dame takes its place in the Atlantic Division for that sport.
