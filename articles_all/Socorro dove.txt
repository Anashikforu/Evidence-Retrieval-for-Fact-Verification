The '''Socorro dove''' (''Zenaida graysoni'') is a dove that was Endemism|endemic to Socorro Island on the west coast of Mexico. The last bird was seen there in 1972. For this reason, International Union for the Conservation of Nature|IUCN has classified the species as extinct in the wild. In captivity, there are not more than about 200 and probably fewer than 100 purebred birds. Because of this, a reintroduction program is being prepared.BLI (2004), Schmechel (2006)

It is a close relative of the mourning dove|mourning and eared doves.Johnson & Clayton (2000) It was at one time considered a subspecies of the mourning dove.
