History
In the early 1930s, an American gymnastics|gymnast George Nissen observed ''trapeze'' artistes performing tricks when bouncing off the ''safety net''. He made the first modern trampoline in his garage to reproduce that net on a smaller scale and used it to help with his diving and tumbling activities. It was the beginning of a new sport.

In the USA, trampolining was quickly introduced into school physical education programs and was also used in private entertainment centers. Since trampolining became an Olympic Games|Olympic sport in 2000, many countries have started developing programs for producing very competitive athletes.
