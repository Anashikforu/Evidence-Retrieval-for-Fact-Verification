'''''Salmonella'''''Salmonella is typically pronounced /ˌsælməˈnɛlə/ voicing the initial letter "L," since it is named for pathologist Daniel Elmer Salmon. is a genus of bacteria. It is a major cause of illness throughout the world. The bacteria are generally passed on to humans by eating or drinking food of animal origin which has the bacteria in it, mainly meat, poultry, egg (food)|eggs and milk. Bacteria from the genus ''Salmonella'' can cause diseases, such as diarrhea, cholera and typhus. These bacteria are zoonosis|zoonotic, meaning they can infect both animals and humans. 

''Salmonella'' is closely related to the ''Escherichia'' genus and are found worldwide in cold- and warm-blooded animals (including humans), and in the environment. They cause illnesses like typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, and foodborne illness.

''Salmonella'' is also extremely dangerous, and like most diseases, weaker humans like the old and young could easily die from it. ''Salmonella'' can only be killed in food by cooking at high temperatures. This is called denaturation.
