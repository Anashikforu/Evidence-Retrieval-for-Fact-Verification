'''Fellatio''' is oral sex performed on the penis. Fellatio is often called a '''blow job'''. The opposite of this is cunnilingus. Cunnilingus is oral sex performed on the vulva. 
Fellatio can continue until the receiver ejaculation|ejaculates or as part of foreplay, before actual sexual intercourse. 

 Risks 
There is no risk of pregnancy|getting pregnant by performing a fellatio, because there is no connection from the mouth to the womb and the fallopian tubes. There is however a large risk of transmitting sexually transmitted disease|diseases if the mouth comes in contact with semen on the penis.
Very few people are allergy|allergic to semen.
Diseases such as Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia, human papillomavirus (HPV), gonorrhea, herpes, hepatitis (multiple strains), and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), as well as viruses such as HIV, can be transmitted through oral sex. The risk of transmitting HIV through fellatio is unknown, but it is thought to be low. Any kind of direct contact with body fluids of a person infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, poses a risk of infection. The risk from most of these types of infection, however, is generally considered far lower than that associated with sexual intercourse|vaginal or anal sex.

If the receiving partner has wounds on their genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in their mouth, or bleeding gums, this poses an increased risk of STD transmission. Flossing or undergoing dental work relatively soon before or after giving fellatio can also increase the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth. These wounds, even when they are microscopic, increase the chances of contracting Sexually transmitted disease|STDs that can be transmitted orally under these conditions. Such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common bacteria and viruses found in, around and secreted from the genital regions. Because of this, some medical professionals advise the use of condoms when performing or receiving fellatio with a partner whose STD status is unknown. Flavoured condoms may be used for this purpose. Alternatively there is flavored lube.

 In culture

Many cultures see fellatio as showing control over ones partner, as often the giver is on their knees. and made vases showing it.
