'''Ravenna''' is a city and ''comune'' in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy.  The city is inland, but is connected to the Adriatic Sea by a canal.  Ravenna once was the seat of the Western Roman Empire and later the Goths|Ostrogothic kingdom. It is presently the capital of the province of Ravenna. At 652.89&nbsp;kmÂ² (252.08 sq mi), Ravenna is the second-largest ''comune'' in land area in Italy, although it is only a little more than half the size of the largest, Rome.
