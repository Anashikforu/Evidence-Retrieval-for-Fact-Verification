'''Trix''' is a brand of breakfast cereal. It is made by General Mills for North America and Cereal Partners in other parts of the world. They are vanilla-flavored puffed cereal pieces. They were first round, brightly colored cereal pieces. In 1991, they were changed to puffed fruit-shaped pieces. In 2006, they were changed back to their round shape in the United States and some other places. In the present, the slogan says: "Trix is not for rabbits!".
