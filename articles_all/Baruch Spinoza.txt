 Key ideas 

An important idea in Spinoza's philosophy is God and Nature (pantheism|everything that exists) are the same thing. Opposing Dualism, Spinoza said that the body and the mind (soul)  are two of God's infinity|infinite attributes. 

There is no Good (philosophy)|good or evil in Nature, and that these words only have meanings for human beings. For a person, an event that leads to happiness is good, and an event that leads to suffering is bad. 

Spinoza describes two types of thoughts, or emotions:

 When a person acts from his own nature, he is said to be ''Active''. The more you understand your actions, the more active you become. Active emotions lead to happiness and an understanding of God, as well as to Freedom. 
 When a person is being influenced by another person, or a thing, he is said to be ''Passive''. 

The goal of every person is to intellectually love God (that is, understand Nature as much as humanly possible).
