'''Epic poetry''' tells a dramatic story in a poem. There are characters in the story. It is usually long, and takes place in different settings. Epic poems started in prehistoric times as part of oral tradition. The Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz Epic of Manas is one of the longest written epics in history.
''Beowulf'' is a typical example, written in Old English. Well-known people who wrote epics were Homer, Publius Vergilius Maro|Virgil, Publius Ovidius Naso|Ovid, Dante, Edmund Spenser and John Milton|Milton. William Wordsworth's Prelude plays with epic ideas though the poem is autobiography.

Characteristics 
Epics have seven main characteristics: 
# The hero is outstanding. They might be important, and historically or legendarily significant.
# The setting is large. It covers many nations, or the known world.
# The action is made of deeds of great valor or requiring superhuman courage.
# Supernatural forces—gods, angels, demons—insert themselves in the action.
# It is written in a very special style (verse as opposed to prose).
# The poet tries to remain objective.
# Epic poems are believed to be supernatural and real by the hero and the villain
 
Conventions of epics: 
# It starts with the theme or subject of the story.
# In epics inspired from Western civilization the writer invokes a Muse, one of the nine daughters of Zeus.  The poet prays to the Muses to provide divine inspiration to tell the great story.  
# Narrative opens ''in medias res'', or in the middle of things, usually with the hero at his lowest point. Usually flashbacks show earlier portions of the story.
# Catalogues and genealogies are given. These long lists of objects, places, and people place the finite action of the epic within a broader, universal context. Often, the poet is also paying homage to the ancestors of audience members.
# Main characters give extended formal speeches.
#
# Use of the epic simile.
# Heavy use of repetition or stock phrases.
# It presents the heroic ideals such as courage, honour, sacrifice, patriotism and kindness.
# An epic gives a clear picture of the social and cultural patterns of the contemporary life. Beowulf thus shows the love of wine, wild celebration, war, adventure and sea-voyages.
