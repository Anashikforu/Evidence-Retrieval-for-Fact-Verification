The '''visual system''' is the part of the nervous system which allows organisms to visual perception|see.
It interprets the information from visible light to build a representation of the world surrounding the body. The visual system has the complex task of (re)constructing a three dimensional world from a two dimensional projection of that world. The psychological manifestation of visual information is known as visual perception.

Introduction
This article mostly describes the visual system of mammals, although other "higher" animals have similar visual systems. In this case, the visual system consists of:

 The eye, especially the retina
 The optic nerve
 The optic chiasma
 The optic tract
 The lateral geniculate nucleus
 The optic tectum (superior colliculus)
 The optic radiation
 The visual cortex
 The visual association cortex

Different species are able to see different parts of the light spectrum; for example, bees can see into the ultraviolet,J Bellingham, SE Wilkie, AG Morris, JK Bowmaker and DM Hunt (1997), "Characterisation of the ultraviolet-sensitive opsin gene in the honey bee, Apis mellifera", ''European Journal of Biochemistry'', Vol '''243''', 775-781
