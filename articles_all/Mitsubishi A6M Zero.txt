The '''Mitsubishi A6M Zero''', often called just the '''A6M Zero''' or simply the '''Zero''' was a long range carrier ship-based fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. The aircraft was built by Mitsubishi, making its first flight in 1939, and entering naval service in 1940.This airplane type was named "zero" because it entered service in 1940; and 1940 was the 26'''00'''th year since Emperor Jimmu, the first Emperor of Japan.  The Japanese Imperial Year was ''Kōki 26'''00''''' (皇紀2600年). 

It was the primary fighter used by Japan during the war. It was the primary enemy of US Naval aircraft such as the Grumman F4F Wildcat, Vought F4U Corsair, and later the Grumman F6F Hellcat, which was specifically designed to combat the Zero. The A6M Zero was the best fighter at the beginning of the Pacific war. However, late in the war, new American fighters were able to defeat it.
