'''Hurricane Fico''' of the 1978 Pacific hurricane season was a tropical cyclone that caused damage in Hawaii.

Storm history
 
A tropical depression formed on July 7 and organized into the sixth tropical storm of the season the next day. Initially heading west-northwest, it changed direction to almost due west shortly after reaching Saffir_Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4 intensity on July 11. After spending over a day at that intensity, Fico decayed and fell back down to a mid-range Category 1 on July 14. Fico then reintensified back to Category 4 strength the next day.

The hurricane's strength fluctuated, but Fico stayed a major hurricane until July 17, when it entered the central Pacific as a Category 1. It slowly intensified and became a major hurricane yet again on the July 21|21st. At this point, Fico turned to the northwest and slowly lost strength. The storm dropped to a tropical storm early on July 28, and went extratropical later that day. At a later date, the remnants were enmeshed in a mid-latitude cyclone|frontal system which headed towards the Aleutian Islands.

Fico was a tropical cyclone for 20 days, and travelled a distance of roughly 5500&nbsp;mi (9000&nbsp;km), both of which were records. It was also a hurricane for 17 consecutive days. Both of Fico's records have been broken. 1992 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Tina|Hurricane Tina and then Hurricane John outlasted Fico. John also outran its distance record.

Impact
Fico never made landfall. Despite this, it pounded the Hawaii (island)|Big Island with 15-30 foot waves doing "considerable damage" 
The name Fico was retired after this storm and replaced with '''Fabio''' in the 1982 Pacific hurricane season|1982 season.
