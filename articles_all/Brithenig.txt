'''Brithenig''' is constructed language that was made up by '''Andrew Smith''' from New Zealand in 1996. The idea behind it is the question what the Welsh language would have looked like if it had been a Romance languages|Romance instead of a Celtic language|Celtic language: a sister language to French language|French, Spanish language|Spanish and Italian language|Italian, but one that looks much like Welsh. It plays a key-role in the made-up world of Ill Bethisad, where Latin language|Latin took the place of Old Celtic as the spoken language of the people in Great Britain, thus giving way to the development of Brithenig.

Brithenig is the best known example of the so-called group of "alternative languages", languages that could have existed if history had been different. Another well-known example is Wenedyk, which does the same with Polish language|Polish as Brithenig does with Welsh.
