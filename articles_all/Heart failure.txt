Someone with heart failure can have Dyspnea|shortness of breath (which may be Orthopnea|worse when they lie flat), waking up breathless at night, Oedema|swelling of the legs, and needing to urinate often during the night. There are many reasons why someone can get heart failure. Most often, heart failure is caused by heart attacks, high blood pressure, or problems with the heart valves. 

A Medical doctor|doctor makes a Medical diagnosis|diagnosis of heart failure by asking about the symptoms above, and examining the heart, blood vessels, lungs, liver (for swelling) and legs (for swelling or edema). Other tests to prove the diagnosis are Chest x-ray|X-rays of the lungs, an echocardiogram (an ultrasound test of the heart) and Blood test|blood tests. 

Heart failure can only be cured with a heart transplant, which is not done often, but most people with heart failure need to take diuretic medicines and other medication (ACE inhibitor, statin). Some people with heart failure are treated with an artificial pacemaker that makes the heart work better.
