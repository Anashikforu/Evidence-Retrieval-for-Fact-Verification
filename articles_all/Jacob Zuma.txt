On 29 June 2021, Zuma was sentenced to fifteen months in prison for not showing up to court over his corruption trial.

In August 2021, Jacob Zuma would receive an insufficient pension to cover his legal costs. In any case, this is what his relatives suggest, who are calling on their fellow citizens to contribute to their former head of state.

In September 2021, the South African Constitutional Court scathingly dismissed former President Jacob Zuma's petition to reverse his ruling sentencing him to 15 months in prison for contempt of justice.
