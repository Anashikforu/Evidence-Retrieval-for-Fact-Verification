'''''Torvosaurus''''' was a large carnivorous dinosaur, 
from the Upper Jurassic. It lived about 153 to 148 million years ago in what is now Colorado and Portugal.

''Torvosaurus'', possibly the largest carnivore of its time,Hendrickx C. & Mateus O.V. 2014. ''Torvosaurus gurneyi'' n. sp., the largest terrestrial predator from Europe, and a proposed terminology of the maxilla anatomy in nonavian theropods. ''PLoS ONE'' '''9''' (3): e88905. 
Studies suggest that the natural environment|paleoenvironment of this part of the Morrison Formation had rivers flowing from the west into a basin with a giant, salinity|saline alkaline lake. There were extensive wetlands nearby. Fossils from the Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry of western Colorado show one of the most diverse Upper Jurassic vertebrate assemblages in the world.Richmond D.R. & Morris T.H. 1999. Stratigraphy and cataclysmic deposition of the Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry, Mesa County, Colorado. In Carpenter K; Kirkland J. and Chure D. eds. The Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation: An Interdisciplinary Study. ''Modern Geology'' '''22''', no. 1-4, pp. 121â€“143.   The Dry Mesa Quarry has produced the remains of the sauropods ''Apatosaurus'', ''Diplodocus'', ''Barosaurus'', ''Supersaurus'', ''Dystylosaurus'', ''Camarasaurus'', the iguanodontid ''Camptosaurus'', and the theropods ''Allosaurus'', ''Ceratosaurus'' and ''Ornitholestes'', as well as  ''Dryosaurus'', and ''Stegosaurus''.
