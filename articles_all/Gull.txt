There are many different types of gull but most of them are white, with grey or black wings, a yellow beak and are about the size of a chicken (but some are smaller). Gulls can eat most types of food but like meat more than anything else.

Most types of seagull are awake during the day and sleep at night. They like to sleep on beaches  but will also sleep on water, like lakes or the sea when the water is calm.
