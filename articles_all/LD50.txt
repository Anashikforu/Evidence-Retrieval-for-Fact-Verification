The name '''LD50''' is an abbreviation for "Lethal Dose, 50%" or median lethal dose. It is the amount of the substance required (usually per body weight) to kill 50% of the test population.

The test was created by J.W. Trevan in 1927

Examples

 Oral LD50 of ethanol|grain alcohol: 10.6 g/kg in young rats, 7.06 g/kg in aged rats. Oral LD50 of nicotine: 50&nbsp;mg/kg in rats.
 Oral LD50 of Sodium chloride|Table Salt: 3000&nbsp;mg/kg in rats 
 LD50 of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) LD50 of smoked and inhaled Cannabis or Marijuana: Unknown. At present it is estimated that marijuana's therapeutic index is around 1:20,000 or 1:40,000 (the "1" in the prior estimate is based on an "effective dose" of the .9 grams contained in NIDA-supplied marijuana cigarettes, although the potency of Cannabis changes based on the genetics of the source plant)
 LD50 of Batrachotoxin: estimated at 1 to 2 Âµg/kg in humans.
 LD50 of Polonium 210: estimated at 10 (inhaled) to 50 (ingested) nanograms in humans makes this one of the most toxic substances known.  One gram in theory could poison 100 million people of which 50 million would die.
