'''Dwarf planet''' is the name used to classify some objects in the solar system. This definition was made on August 24, 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), and can be described as; ''a dwarf planet is a body orbiting the Sun that is big enough to round itself by its own gravity, but has not cleared its orbital path of other rival bodies''. At the same meeting the IAU also defined the term planet for the first time. Some astronomers think that the term "dwarf planet" is too confusing and needs to be changed.

The nine dwarf planets, in order from their distance from the Sun are:
 Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres (in the Asteroid belt)
 90482 Orcus|Orcus
 Pluto (dwarf planet)|Pluto (Pluto was named by an 11-year-old girl because it was the initials of the astronomer who found it. )
 Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea
 50000 Quaoar|Quaoar
 Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake
 225088 Gonggong|Gonggong
 Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris
 90377 Sedna|Sedna

The dwarf planets, unlike the Terrestrial planet|terrestrial and Gas giant|gas giant planets, are in more than one region of the solar system. Ceres is in the asteroid belt. The high orbital eccentricity of Pluto puts it mostly outside Neptune's orbit, but partly inside. The others are in the Trans-Neptunian object|trans-Neptune region.

NASA's ''Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn'' and ''New Horizons'' missions reached Ceres and Pluto, respectively, in 2015. ''Dawn'' had already orbited and observed 4 Vesta|Vesta in 2011.

There are many other dwarf planets in the solar system. Most of them are also Kuiper belt objects.
