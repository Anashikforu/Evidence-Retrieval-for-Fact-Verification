The F-16 is able to fly at twice the speed of sound. It is armed with a M61 Vulcan Gatling gun and has eleven places where weapons or other equipment can be attached. It was the first production combat airplane to be designed relaxed stability|to be unstable to be easier to turn, and has Fly-By-Wire|easier controls to make it highly aerobatics|agile in the air. Its designers also used many other new ideas such as a bubble canopy to help the pilot see better and a control stick on the side of the cockpit to make it easier to steer during tight turns and high g-forces.

The F-16's official name is "Fighting Falcon", but it is often called the "Viper" by its pilots and crews. The nickname came from the fact that the viper snake is known for its deadly fangs and venom, and because the Colonial Viper spacecraft from ''Battlestar Galactica'' was popular when the airplane was introduced to the USAF.Aleshire 2005, p. xxii.Peacock 1997, p. 100.
