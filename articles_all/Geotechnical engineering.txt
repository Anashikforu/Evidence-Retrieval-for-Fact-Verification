'''Geotechnical engineering''' is an important subset of civil engineering dealing with engineering performance of earth materials. Geotechnical engineering uses principles of soil and Rock (geology)|rock mechanics to determine:
 subsurface conditions and materials; 
 relevant physical/mechanical and chemical properties of these materials;
 stability of natural slopes and man-made soil deposits; 
 risks posed by site conditions; 
to design:
 earthworks;
 structure Foundation (engineering)|foundations;
and to monitor: 
 site conditions; 
 earthwork and foundation construction.Terzaghi, K., Peck, R.B. and Mesri, G. (1996), ''Soil Mechanics in Engineering Practice'' 3rd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 

Foundations built for above-ground structures include shallow and deep foundations. Retaining structures include earth-filled dams and retaining walls.
