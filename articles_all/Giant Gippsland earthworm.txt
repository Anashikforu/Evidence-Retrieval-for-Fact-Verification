The '''giant Gippsland earthworm''' (''Megascolides australis'') is one of Australia's 1,000 native earthworm species. These Giant earthworms average at 100 centimeter|cm long and 2&nbsp;cm in diameter and can reach 3 metre|m in length.
The worms are found in the Bass River Valley of South Gippsland, near Korumburra, Victoria|Korumburra and Warragul, Victoria|Warragul. They are only found in a small area, of about 100,000 hectares. They live in small pockets of blue-grey clay close to water. They live in burrows about 500mm deep, and can burrow as deep as 1.5m.

The habitat the worms used to live in was tall eucalypt forests. Most of this has been cleared for farming, but the worms have continued to survive because they live deep underground. They have been listed a vulnerable species because of these changes. The worms only lay a single egg, between 4-7cm in size. These can take up to one year to hatch, and the worms take several years to become adults, and be able to reproduce. This slow rate of growth, also makes them a vulnerable species.
