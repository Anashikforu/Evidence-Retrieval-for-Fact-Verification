 History 
Seizing power in Egypt, they were soon able to extend their dominion to the Yemen, Syria, and much of the Jazira. However, they lost the bulk of their lands during the crises of the mid-seventh/thirteenth century, though they did continue to hold two minor principalities for some time thereafter (Hama until 1341, Hisn Kayfa until 1462). In addition, many members of the family continued to be maintained in Egypt as pensioners of the Mamluk sultanate until the early eighth/fourteenth century.Humphreys, R. S.

Vol. III, Fasc. 2, pp. 164–167, "Seizing power in '''Egypt''' in 564/1168, they were soon able to extend their dominion to the '''Yemen''', '''Syria''', and much of the '''Jazīra'''.

S. "AYYUBIDS", Encyclopædia Iranica. Vol. III, Fasc. 2, pp. 164–167, "In the light of the above outline, is it proper to think of the Ayyubid confederation as a specifically “Kurdish” state? On the level of political structure, the governing attitudes of the Ayyubid confederation can certainly be related to the political institutions of their original homeland. On the other hand, these institutions do not differ significantly from the underlying structures of contemporary Turkish states (...)"
