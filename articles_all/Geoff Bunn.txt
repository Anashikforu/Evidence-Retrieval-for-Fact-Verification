'''Geoff Bunn''' is an Anglo-Swedish author and artist. He was born in Birmingham, England in 1963.  He has been in galleries such as the Tate Gallery|Tate but is better known for placing his work in the ordinary environment rather than 'traditional' art galleries.  During the early 2000s, he worked in France, for a time, with painter Fred Yates.

Bunn has also painted a number of large and rather disturbing canvases of empty interiors. This series of paintings - which Bunn entitles 'Interior Landscapes' - led to Bunn being awarded the Cartazini Biennial Art Award|Cartazini Prize in 2007.

Bunn has written a number of books, including the best-selling transgender romance ''Blonde Boy, Red Lipstick''.
