The '''Pope''' is the head of the Catholic Church.
Popes are elected by Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals of the Catholic Church. Once they are elected they hold the position until they die or resign. Usually they do not resign, though; Pope Benedict XVI is the only Pope to resign in the last 500 years.  A newly elected Pope chooses a regnal name.  Everyone is told this new name when the Habemus Papam is read out. The current pope (Francis) was called Jorge Bergoglio before he became a pope.

The name ''Pope'' comes from the Greek language|Greek word ''pappas'', meaning "father". Catholics believe that when making statements ''ex cathedra'', that is official statements teaching about faith and morals, the Pope is ''infallible'' - which means God will not allow his followers to be misled by allowing their leader to make a wrong statement. Only two of any Pope's statements have been ''ex cathedra''.Apostolic constitution ''Munificentissimus Deus'', written by Pope Pius XII, 1 November 1950 ; Apostolic constitution ''Ineffabilis Deus'', written by Pope Pius IX, 8 December 1854. 

Popes today travel to many countries around the world preaching. The Pope is the only person in the world who both leads the church and government. Like other bishops he wears a big hat called a mitre and holds a staff called a crosier.

 The Popes in Avignon 
During parts of the Middle Ages, the French kings had a lot of influence in Europe. For this reason, seven popes (and two anti-popes) lived in Avignon, rather than Rome. The Avignon Papacy was from 1309 to 1377. During that time, the popes were known for their greed and corruption.Will Durant|Durant, Will. The Reformation. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1957. "Chapter I. The Roman Catholic Church." 1300-1517. p. 3-25 These popes were ally|allies of France; the enemies of France were also their enemies.Will Durant|Durant, Will. The Reformation. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1957. "Chapter II. England: Wyclif, Chaucer, and the Great Revolt." 1308-1400. p. 26-57

The Bishops of Rome who lived in Avignon were:
#Pope Clement V: 1305–1314
#Pope John XXII: 1316–1334
#Pope Benedict XII: 1334–1342
#Pope Clement VI: 1342–1352
#Pope Innocent VI: 1352–1362
#Pope Urban V: 1362–1370
#Pope Gregory XI: 1370–1378

Two antipopes were based in Avignon as well:
Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII: 1378–1394
Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII: 1394–1423 (expelled from Avignon in 1403)

Antipopes were people that were elected by small groups who did not like the official choice. 
Catherine of Siena convinced pope Gregory XI to move back to Rome. Unfortunately, he died shortly after moving. The cardinals then elected Pope Urban VI|Urban VI to be the next pope. The French cardinals did not recognise this election as legitimate. They declared the papal see as vacant; which led to the Western Schism. The schism lasted until the Council of Constance in 1417. During this time, there was a pope in Rome, an Antipope in Avignon, and for some time, a second antipope. Each of the three was recognised as legitimate pope by different European powers. This led to a big split in the church as a whole. The council elected Pope Martin V as a new pope, recognised by all parties.
