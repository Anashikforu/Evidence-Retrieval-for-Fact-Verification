'''Subtraction''' is the arithmetic operation for finding the wikt:difference|difference between two numbers, though it can also be generalized to other mathematical objects such as Vector|vectors and Matrix (mathematics)|matrices. For example, the expression 7 - 4 = 3 can be read as "seven minus four equals three," "seven take away four leaves three," or "four from seven leaves three."

If the minuend is less than the subtrahend, the difference will be a negative number. For example, 17 - 25 = -8 . This can be read as "Seventeen minus twenty-five equals negative eight."  

Subtraction is how cash registers determine the change (money)|change a buyer receives, when the buyer pays with more money than the purchase cost.
