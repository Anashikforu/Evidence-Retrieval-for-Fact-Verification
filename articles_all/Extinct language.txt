An '''extinct language''' is a language that no longer is the first language or the second language of anyone.  The opposite of a modern language, an extinct language is not spoken anymore and so no longer develops or changes. The first recorded example in human history is Sumerians|Sumerian.

It is not to be confused with a Language death|dead language, such as Latin, which is still spoken as a second language.
