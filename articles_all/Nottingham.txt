 History 
The first evidence of settlement dates from pre-Roman times, and it is clear that the Romans also lived in the area.

An early name for Nottingham was "Tigguo Cobauc" which means "a place of caves."  Founded by Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon invaders after 600&nbsp;AD, parts of the settlement have included man-made caves, dug into soft sandstone.
Nottingham was later captured by the Denmark|Danes (Vikings) and in the 9th century became one of the five boroughs (fortified towns) of the Danelaw.


The legend of Robin Hood developed in the Middle Ages. Robin Hood is said to have lived in Sherwood Forest, which extended from the north of Nottingham to the north side of Doncaster, Yorkshire.  His main opponent was the Sheriff of Nottingham.  While the legends are almost certainly untrue, particularly in their details, they have had a major impact on Nottingham, with Robin Hood imagery a popular choice for local businesses and many modern tourist attractions use the legend. The Robin Hood Statue in Nottingham is outside the Nottingham Castle within walking distance from the Old Market Square.

Three Public house|pubs in Nottingham claim the title of ''England's Oldest Pub''. The wikt:contender|contenders are Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem near the castle, The Bell on the Old Market Square, and The Salutation on Maid Marian Way.
