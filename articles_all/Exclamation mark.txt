An '''exclamation mark''' ('''!''') is a punctuation mark. It is used to show strong emotion at the end of a sentence or after an interjection.

Putting a space before an exclamation mark is incorrect.

In coding, "!" sometimes means ''not''. In mathematics, the use of an exclamation mark can be used for the factorial function (for example, n!).
