The Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation '''2Bil''' to the Direct current|DC third rail electric multiple units built during the 1930s to work long-distance semi-fast services on the newly electrified lines from London to Eastbourne, Portsmouth and Reading. This type of unit survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated TOPS '''Class 401'''.
