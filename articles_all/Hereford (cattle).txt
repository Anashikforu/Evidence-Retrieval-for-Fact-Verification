'''Hereford''' cattle are a widely used breed in temperate areas, mainly for Beef cattle|beef production.

Originally from Herefordshire, England,
Hornless variants with the polled livestock|polled gene are known as the Polled Herefords. Breeding horned and hornless together functions as a genetic dehorner. This is often used as an alternative to a dehorning process, which causes stress and often weight loss.
