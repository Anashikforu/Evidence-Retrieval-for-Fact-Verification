'''Tardigrades''' ('water bears') are Microscope|microscopic, segmented animals. 

Tardigrades were first wikt:describe|described in 1773.

Tardigrades have a cylinder|cylindrical shape with four segments, each with two legs. Each leg has little claws. The biggest adults may reach a body length of 1.2&nbsp;mm, the smallest below 0.1&nbsp;mm. Freshly hatched larvae may be smaller than 0.05&nbsp;mm. Tardigrades feed on plant cells by wikt:penetrate|penetrating the cell wall and eating what is inside. Some tardigrades are carnivores.

Tardigrades are eutelic: all adult tardigrades of the same species have the same number of Cell (biology)|cells. Some species have as many as 40,000 cells in each adult, while others have far fewer.Seki, Kunihiro; Toyoshima, Masato 1998. Preserving tardigrades under pressure.

Tardigrades can be found in many habitats: in moss, freshwater, the Himalayas, and the ocean. They are one of the few animals that can be found on the highest mountains and the deepest seas. About 83% of the known species live on land, the other 17% live in water.

 Survivability 
Tardigrades are able to live in environments that would kill most animals. 

In 2007, scientists discovered that some tardigrades were able to wikt:survive|survive 10 days in outer space. 

Tardigrades can survive more than ten years without water.

Tardigrades can also survive radiation at hundreds of times a level that would be deadly to humans,

In 2019, a lander with Tardigrades on board crashed on the moon. It is believed that the Tardigrades survived and could live for a few years on the moon.

The tardigrades slow their metabolism to survive these environments. See rotifers for a similar account of survivability.
