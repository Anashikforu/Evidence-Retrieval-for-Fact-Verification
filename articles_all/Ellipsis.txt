An '''ellipsis''' is a type of punctuation mark. In writing, it is a row of three points (...). Its name comes from the Ancient Greek language|ancient Greek word ''ἔλλειψις'' (omission/falling short). Notice that the three dots are not spaced as full points: they are a separate special typographic sign.

Depending on context and place in a sentence, ellipses can indicate an unfinished thought, a leading statement, a slight pause, a mysterious or echoing voice, or a nervous or awkward silence. An ellipsis can be used to trail off into silence—for example: ''But I thought he was...''

 ''So much more could be said...''
