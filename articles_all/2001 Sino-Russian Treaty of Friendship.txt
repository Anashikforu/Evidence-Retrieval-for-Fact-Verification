The '''Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation Between the People's Republic of China and the Russia|Russian Federation''' (FCT) is a treaty outlining a twenty-year cooperation between China and Russia. It was signed by the leaders of the two world powers, Jiang Zemin and Vladimir Putin, on July 16, 2001.

 Contents of the treaty 
The treaty describes actions that should be taken by the two countries to establish for peaceful relations and economic cooperation, as well as diplomacy|diplomatic and politics|political reliance. Article 9 of the treaty has started controversy because it may be viewed as a defense (military)|defense Treaty|pact, meaning if one of the two countries becomes involved in a war, the other country must help them. Additionally, articles A7 and A16 point at increasing military cooperation, including the sharing of "military know-how" (A16), namely, Chinese access to Russian military technology.

The treaty also describes a mutual, cooperative approach to environmental technology Environmental law|regulations and energy conservation; and toward international finance and trade. The document affirms Russia's stand on political status of Taiwan|Taiwan as "an inalienable part of China" (A5), and highlights the commitment to ensure the "national unity and territorial integrity" in the two countries (A4).

 Possible benefits 
Analysts have pointed out several different reasons for the FCT, mostly involving benefits for both China and Russia.

= China =
 China's Military of the People's Republic of China|armed forces are largely outdated, and they want to improve them. The treaty says that Russia will share their training and technology with China, which will help that.
 China wants a stable, consistent and affordable level of fuel shipments, especially petroleum. This goal can be better met by using Russian oil, including the construction of a Trans-Siberian oil pipeline.
 China wants support for its Cross-Strait relations|stance on Taiwan.

= Russia =
 Russia has had trouble getting Capital (economics)|capital since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It will be able to get more capital in several ways through the treaty. They are:
 Russia wants to find employment for its skilled workforce.
 Russia wants to sell its military technology and knowledge.
 Russia wants to sell its large reserves of petroleum and natural gas.

= Fear of US influence =
Both China and Russia fear the United States (especially following its strengthened geopolitical position following the September 11, 2001 attacks) becoming involved in areas which they believe should only be affected by their respective spheres of national influences and interests: for China, this largely involves Political status of Taiwan|Taiwan serving as a US client state, while for Russia it involves having various former Soviet Republics as US client states. Many of these do not border either country, though Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan border China, and Kazakhstan borders both.

= Economic competition with the US, Japan and the EU =
The United States, Japan and the European Union are three economic powers which have a skilled workforce and access to capital. Russia and China can more effectively compete against these powers in the world economy if Russia has access to Chinese capital and China has access to Russian training and technology.
