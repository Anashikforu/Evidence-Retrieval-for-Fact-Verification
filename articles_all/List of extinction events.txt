An '''extinction event''' is a relatively fast drop in the number of species living on Earth. It occurs when the rate of extinction increases more than the rate of speciation. This is a list of the largest. Major extinction events are important to both geology and evolution.Huggett, Richard J. 1997. ''Catastrophism''. new ed. Verso.Elewa A.M.T. (ed) 2008. ''Mass extinctions''. Springer, Berlin.

 The Phanerozoic 

There are five major extinction events in the Phanerozoic eon, and many smaller events.Hallam A. and Wignall P.B. 1997. ''Mass extinctions and their aftermath''. Oxford. In order of time, latest first:

1. K/T extinction event. The Cretaceous/Tertiary extinction event ended the Mesozoic era and started the Cainozoic era.

2. End–Triassic extinction event.Benton M.J. 1991. What really happened in the Late Triassic? ''Historical biology'' '''5''', 263–278.Benton M.J. 1995. Diversification and extinction in the history of life. ''Science'' '''268''', 52–58.

3. P/Tr extinction event. The Permian/Triassic extinction event ended the Palaeozoic era and started the Mesozoic era.Benton M.J. 2005. ''When life nearly died: the greatest mass extinction of all time''. Thames & Hudson, London. isbn=978-0500285732Erwin DH 1993. ''The great Paleozoic crisis; life and death in the Permian'' Columbia, N.Y. isbn=0231074670

4. Late Devonian extinctions, at the Frasnian/Famennian junction.McGhee, George R. Jr 1996. ''The Late Devonian mass extinction: the Frasnian/Famennian crisis''. Columbia, N.Y. 

5. End–Ordovician extinction event. After a series of lesser events, the end-Ordovician extinction resulted in an estimated 84% species loss.Jablonski D. 1994. Extinctions in the fossil record. ''Phil Trans Roy Soc'' '''B344''', 11–17.

Other extinction events in the Phanerozoic also had significant impact on the evolution of the biota.

#Eocene
#Vendian/Cambrian extinction event. Extinctions have been claimed for three groups: the acritarchs, trace fossils, and the famous Ediacaran biota|Ediacaran fossils. Not much is known about this event.
