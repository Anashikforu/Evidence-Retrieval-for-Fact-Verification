 
In physical geography, a '''dune''' is a hill of sand, usually Deposition (geology)|deposited by eolian processes (wind) or sometimes by the flow of water. Dunes occur, for example, in some deserts and beaches. Sand dunes have different forms and sizes based on their interaction with the wind. Sometimes they migrate downwind. A "dune field" is an area covered by many sand dunes.
