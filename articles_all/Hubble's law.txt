#All objects observed in deep space have a doppler shift-measured velocity relative to Earth, and to each other; 
#The doppler-shift-measured velocity of galaxy|galaxies moving away from Earth, is Proportionality|proportional to their distance from the Earth and all other interstellar bodies.  

In effect, the space-time volume of the observable universe is expanding and Hubble's law is the direct physical observation of this. It is the basis for believing in the '''expansion of the universe''' and is evidence often cited in support of the Big Bang model.

Although widely attributed to Edwin Hubble, the law was first derived from the General Relativity equations by Georges Lemaître in a 1927 article. There he proposed that the Universe is expanding, and suggested a value for the rate of expansion, now called the '''Hubble constant'''.. 

The law is often expressed by the equation  away. The reciprocal of ''H''0 is the Hubble's law#Hubble time|Hubble time.

A recent 2011 estimate of the Hubble constant, which used a new infrared camera on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to measure the distance and redshift for a collection of astronomical objects, gives a value of .
A number of other methods have been used, giving figures between 70 and 72 (km/s)/Mpc. A recent (2016) method using the oldest light in the universe  suggests the Hubble Constant value was 66.53km/s per megaparsec soon after the expansion began. This implies that the rate of expansion has been increasing.Amos, Jonathan 2016. Hubble clocks faster cosmic expansion. ''BBC News'' Science & Environment.
