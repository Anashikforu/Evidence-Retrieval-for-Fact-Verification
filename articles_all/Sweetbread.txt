'''Sweetbreads''' or '''ris''' are culinary names for the thymus or the pancreas glands especially of the veal|calf (''ris de veau'') and lamb and mutton|lamb (''ris d'agneau'') (although beef and pork sweetbreads are also eaten).Oxford Companion to Food, Oxford English Dictionary

Various other glands used as food have also been called 'sweetbreads', including the parotid gland, the sublingual glands, and testicles (''cf.'' Rocky Mountain oyster).W. A. Newman Dorland, ''The american illustrated medical dictionary'', 1922 
One common preparation of sweetbreads involves brining|soaking in salt water, then Poaching (cooking)|poaching in milk, after which the outer membrane is removed.  Once dried and chilled, they are often breading|breaded and frying|fried.  They are also used for stuffing or in pâtés. They are grilled in many Latin American cuisines, such as in the Argentina|Argentine asado, and served in bread in Turkish cuisine.

The word "sweetbread" is first known in the 16th century, but the logic behind the name is unclear.Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1989 "Sweet (taste)|Sweet" is perhaps used since the thymus is sweet and rich tasting, as opposed to Umami|savoury tasting muscle flesh.
