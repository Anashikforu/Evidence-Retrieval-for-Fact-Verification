'''Angkor Wat''' () is a temple complex at Siem Reap, Cambodia, built for the Hindu king Suryavarman II in the early 12th century as his state temple and capital city. Before long it became a Buddhist site. It is the world's largest religious building. Angkor fell into decline after the 14th Century.
