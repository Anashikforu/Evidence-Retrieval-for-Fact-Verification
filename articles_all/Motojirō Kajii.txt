He died at a young age and wrote few works, but his stories have become influence|influential in Japanese culture. For example, many high school students imitate the protagonist of his short story ''"Lemon"'', leaving a lemon in a department store."&nbsp;I read an article about Maruzen closing its business in yesterday's Asahi Journal Evening Edition. It claims that many people are leaving lemons in the department store, just like the main character in Motojiro Kajii's short story titled ''Lemon''. Coincidentally, I learned that many people are buying ''Lemon'' from the bookstore inside Maruzen. ''Lemon'' is featured in school textbooks; there are not many Japanese who do not know the story. I am fond of the story myself. I learned the name Maruzen for the first time through ''Lemon''. To be perfectly honest... I left a lemon in Maruzen when I was a high school student. My friend did the same. It must have been a nuisance for the people who worked there.&nbsp;" – Hideo Kojima (creator of the Metal Gear Solid video games for Konami), in the
