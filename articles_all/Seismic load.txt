'''Seismic load''' is one of the basic concepts of earthquake engineering which means application of an earthquake-generated agitation to a Building|building structure or its Building model|model. It happens at contact surfaces of a structure either with the ground,
Seismic loading depends, primarily, on:

 Anticipated earthquake’s parameters at the site
 Geology|Geotechnical parameters of the site
 Building|Building structure’s parameters
 Characteristics of the anticipated gravity waves from tsunami (if applicable).

Sometimes, seismic load exceeds ability of a structure to resist it without being broken, partially or completely. Due to their mutual interaction, seismic loading and seismic performance of a structure are intimately related.
