At the Xavier Institute, Rogue, who longs to touch people but cannot, is interested in the cure.

Professor Xavier tracks down Jean Grey.  He and Wolverine and Storm go Jean's old house to try to talk to her.  Early on, he found that Jean Grey had a very powerful side called the Phoenix.

Wolverine, who has gone out there, sees that the Phoenix has teamed up with the Brotherhood and will not leave when Wolverine asks her to.  The government then raids the forest, but Magneto has already left and all the agents find is many copies of the mutant Multiple Man.

Another mutant named Beast comes from behind him and sticks a bunch of cure darts into Magneto, curing him of the mutation.

The U.S Army comes over the top at this point and starts to fire darts.  This causes Phoenix to very angry and she starts to use her powers to begin destroying everything.  With great effort, Wolverine reaches Phoenix and sticks his claws into her to stop her, killing her but saving the soldiers.  Back at the Xavier Institute, they mourn the Jean Grey's death.  Rogue, who has been cured, touchs Bobby's hand for the first time.
