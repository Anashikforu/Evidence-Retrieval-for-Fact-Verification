'''Saturn '''was an car|automobile maker. It was owned by General Motors. It was established on January 7, 1985.  Saturns are sold in the United States and Canada, some even being sold in Japan.  They are currently known for European styling, and no-haggle pricing. IN the past, their most notable feature was plastic body panels.

General Motors tried to sell the company. Penske Automtive was going to buy it, but decided not to. Saturn Corporation went defunct on October 31, 2010 as part of General Motors downsizing due to its bankruptcy. The company was succeeded by Buick as GM's captive import brand. GM also decided to reuse some components of the brand's crossover for Chevrolet and GMC models.
