'''875 North Michigan Avenue''' is a skyscraper in Chicago, United States. It was formerly known as the '''John Hancock Center'''. It is 344 meters (1,127 feet) tall and has 100 floors, including an observation deck on the 94th floor (1,000&nbsp;ft). It was built in 1969 and is one of the tallest buildings in the world.

Name change
On February 12, 2018, John Hancock Insurance requested that its name and logos throughout the building's interior be removed immediately; John Hancock had not had a naming-rights deal with the skyscraper's owners since 2013. Until a new naming-rights deal is finalized, the skyscraper will be known as "875 North Michigan Avenue".
