An '''exabyte''' ('''EB''') is a unit of measurement for computers of the future. One exabyte holds 1000 petabytes ('''PB''') or a million trillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) bytes. An exabyte is large enough that it would take about 10,000 to 100,000 home computers to store this amount of data.

One thousand exabytes make one zettabyte.
