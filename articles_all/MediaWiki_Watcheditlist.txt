Here's a list of all the pages you have on your "watchlist", in alphabetical (abcd) order.  Names of pages that are only redirects to other pages, will show up in green, if you are using the normal skin (monobook).

You can check the boxes of any pages you want to take off your watchlist, then just click the 'remove checked' button at the bottom of the screen. (If you take off a page, its talk page will also be taken off!)
