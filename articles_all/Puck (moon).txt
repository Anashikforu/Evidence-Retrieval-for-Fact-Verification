'''Puck''' is a closer moon to Uranus (planet)|Uranus. Puck was found from the images taken by ''Voyager 2'' on December 30, 1985, and was given the designation '''S/1985&nbsp;U&nbsp;1'''.

In Celtic mythology and English folklore, a ''Puck (mythology)|Puck'' is a mischievous sprite, imagined as an evil demon by Christians; the moon is named after the Puck who appears in Shakespeare's ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', in which he travels around the globe at night with the fairy|fairies. It is also designated '''Uranus&nbsp;XV'''.

Puck is the biggest of the small closer moons to Uranus. It is in the middle in size between Portia (moon)|Portia and Miranda (moon)|Miranda, the smallest of the five bigger moons. Puck's orbit is also located between these two moons. Little is known about it aside from its orbit, its radius about 81&nbsp;km, and its geometric albedo approximately 0.11.

Of the moons found by the ''Voyager&nbsp;2'' imaging team, only Puck was found early enough that the probe could be programmed to take pictures of it in some detail. Images showed that Puck has a shape of a slightly prolate Sphere|spheroid (ratio between axises is 0.97 Â± 0.04). Its surface is heavily cratered
