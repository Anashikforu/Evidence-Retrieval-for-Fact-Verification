The '''normal distribution''' is a probability distribution. It is also called '''Gaussian distribution''' because it was first discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss. The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is very important in many fields of science. 

Normal distributions are a family of distributions of the same general form. These distributions differ in their ''location'' and ''scale'' parameters: the mean ("average") of the distribution defines its location, and the standard deviation ("variability") defines the scale. These two parameters are represented by the symbols \mu and \sigma, respectively.

The '''standard normal distribution''' (also known as the '''Z distribution''') is the normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one (the green curves in the plots to the right). It is often called the '''bell curve,''' because the graph of its probability density function|probability density looks like a bell.

Many values follow a normal distribution. This is because of the central limit theorem, which says that if an event is the sum of identical but random events, it will be normally distributed.

Intelligence is probably normally distributed. There is a problem with accurately defining or measuring it, though.
Insurance companies use normal distributions to model certain average cases.
