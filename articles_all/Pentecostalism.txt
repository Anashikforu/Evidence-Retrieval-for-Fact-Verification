'''Pentecostalism''' is a faith within Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christianity. It believes in a personal experience with God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit (); the same as in the Biblical account on the Day of Pentecost. Pentecostalism is similar to the Charismatic groups, but it came about earlier and separated from the main church branches. Charismatic Christians, at least in the beginning, tended to stay in their religious denomination|denominations and did not divide away.

 Beliefs 
There are different types of Pentecostal churches.
Other groups believe in an "" based salvation. This means a person needs to repentance|repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus. They then receive the Holy Spirit (Holy Ghost). In this belief, the Holy Spirit is required for salvation; which includes speaking in tongues.
Pentecostal churches believe that Jesus still heals the sick, with the power of the Holy Spirit.
They also believe in other gifts such as speaking in tongues, interpretation of tongues, supernatural knowledge, mainly about sickness or spiritual matters, and prophesy about future spiritual happenings. Many also practice exorcism, that is, casting out evil spirits.
