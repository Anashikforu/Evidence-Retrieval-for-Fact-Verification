'''Probability theory''' is the part of mathematics that studies random situations.
Tossing a coin, winning the lottery, or rolling a die are random events. However, random events have certain patterns, which can be studied and predicted, using probability theory. 

Scientists can use probability theory to obtain information about things that would be too complex to deal with, like statistical mechanics.Tolman, R. C. (1979). The principles of statistical mechanics. Courier Corporation.Ruelle, D. (1999). Statistical mechanics: Rigorous results. World Scientific.Thompson, C. J. (2015). Mathematical statistical mechanics. Princeton University Press. Also, scientists discovered (in the 20th century) that Atom|atoms, and everything that we know, obeys something called quantum mechanics,Flügge, S. (2012). Practical quantum mechanics. Springer Science & Business Media.Griffiths, D. J., & Schroeter, D. F. (2018). Introduction to quantum mechanics. Cambridge University Press.Baym, G. (2018). Lectures on quantum mechanics. CRC Press. which uses lots of probability theory.

 History 
The theory of probability was created by Gerolamo Cardano, a medical doctor and Gamble|gambler who tried to calculate his luck. Years later, Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal helped develop Cardano's theory.  

Today, probability theory is used in statistics, which is useful to all kinds of areas: like medicine, economy, Science, Mathematics...
