'''Salam''' (''), sometimes spelled '''salaam''', is an Arabic word that literally means "peace", but is also used as a general greeting, above all in Arabian world|Arabian countries and by the Islam|Muslim countries around the world in general. 

'''As-salamu ʿalaykum''' (). It is also preferred to use the greeting when arriving and also while leaving. It was reported that Abu Hurairah said "When one of you joins a gathering, let him say 'Peace'. When he wants to get up and leave, let him say 'Peace'. The former is not more important than the latter" (Hasan hadith reported in Jāmiʿ at-Tirmidhi). 
 According to hadith, Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.) was asked who should begin the greeting and he said, "The one who is riding should greet the one who is walking and the one who is walking should greet the one who is sitting and the smaller group should greet the larger group" (''Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī'', 6234; Muslim, 2160).
 It is also stated that one should give the Salam greeting upon entering a house. This is based upon a verse of the Quran: "But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a greeting from God blessed and good" (An-Nur24:61).
 Shortening the greeting to acronyms, such as ''A.S.'', ''As'kum'' (in Malaysia), or ''AsA'' is becoming common amongst Internet users in chat rooms and by people using SMS. This trend is similar to writing (S) or SAWS in place of ''ṣallá l-Lāhi ʿalayhi wa s-salām''.
In addition, ''As-Salam'' is one of the 99 Names of God.
