The '''vulva''' is the part of the body of female mammals (including woman|women) where the outside parts of the reproductive system can be seen. The parts of the vulva that can be seen are the:

Mons pubis
Labia majora
Labia minora
Clitoris
Vagina|Vaginal opening
Urethra|Urinary opening

The mons pubis is the area of skin and fat above the other structures. It protects the other structures below it. The labia majora are thick areas of skin and fat located to the side of the urinary and vaginal openings. Smaller and thinner labia are the labia minora. These structures are connected to the hood of the clitoris . They are close to the vagina. Many people call the vagina when they mean the vulva. The vagina is the ''tube'' connecting the internal parts (the womb) to the vulva.
