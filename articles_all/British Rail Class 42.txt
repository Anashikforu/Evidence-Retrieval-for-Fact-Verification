British Railways' (BR) Type 4 "Warship" class diesel-hydraulic locomotives were introduced in 1958. It was apparent at that time that the largest centre of expertise on diesel-hydraulic locomotives was in Germany.  The Western Region of British Railways (in view of post-World War II sensibilities) negotiated a licence with German manufacturers to scale down the DB class V 200|German Federal Railway's "V200" design to suit the smaller loading gauge of the British network, and to allow British manufacturers to construct the new design.  The resultant design bears a close resemblance both cosmetically and in the engineering employed. They were divided into two batches: examples built at Swindon railway works|BR's Swindon works were numbered in the series D800 to D832 and from D866 to D870, had a maximum tractive effort of 52,400 pounds force and are the '''British Rail Class 42''' of this article.  33 others, D833-865, were constructed by the North British Locomotive Company and became British Rail Class 43 (Warship Class)|British Rail Class 43.  They were allocated to Bristol Bath Road TMD|Bristol Bath Road, Laira TMD|Plymouth Laira, Newton Abbot railway station#Engine shed|Newton Abbot and Old Oak Common TMD|Old Oak Common.
