'''Robert Boyle''' Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS (25 January 1627 – 31 December 1691) was a 17th-century natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, inventor and founding member of the Royal Society.

Career
Robert Boyle is best known for Boyle's law.Boyle's Law describes the inverse relationship between the absolute pressure and volume of a gas.

When Robert Hooke was young, Boyle employed him as an instrument-maker and assistant. They continued to cooperate when Hooke took charge of experiments at the Royal Society.

Scientific research was the main focus of Boyle's life.  He joined other like-minded men in a group which called itself the "Invisible College".Kassell, Lauren.  
Boyle was an Alchemy|alchemist, but also the first modern chemist. His 1661 book, ''The Sceptical Chymist'', is important in the history of chemistry.

Religious interests
As a director of the East India Company Boyle spent large sums in promoting the spread of Christianity in the East. He contributed liberally to missionary societies and to the expenses of translating the Bible or portions of it into various languages.

Boyle supported the policy that the Bible should be available in the language of the people, in contrast to the Latin-only policy of the Roman Catholic Church at the time.
