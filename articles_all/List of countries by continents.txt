This article consists of a list of countries by continent, along with their Capital city|capitals.

There are multiple continent classification systems in use. The first continent system is the seven continent system consisting of Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania/Australasia|Australia, North America, South America and Antarctica.

The six continent system is essentially the same as the seven continent system, the only difference being two continents are merged. There are two versions of the six continent system, one merging Europe and Asia to create Eurasia, and the other merging North and South America to create The Americas

The five continent system is applying Eurasia and The Americas together, all other continents remain the same.

Finally the four continent system is the same as the prior, however Africa joins Eurasia to become Afro-Eurasia, leaving only Oceania and Antarctica as separate continents.

The only variable in these systems is Antarctica. As Antarctica has no permanent population it isn't uncommon for it to be removed from these classification systems.

The most common system used varies from country to country.

There is no universally accepted answer as to how many countries in the world there actually are. The minimum answer is the 193 United Nations member states. However, there are many more constituent, de facto and self-proclaimed independent states that are typically added to that list. Additionally certain highly autonomous first level administrative divisions fall under the definition of the word country.

The list below follows the seven continent system and predominantly includes only U.N member states unless otherwise stated.

Africa

Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20% of its land area, accounting for about a fifth of the world's land. With 1.3 billion people as of 2018, it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population. It is surrounded by large areas of water. There are 54 fully recognized and independent countries in Africa, and 14.7% (1.216 billion) of the world's population lives there. It is thought to be the continent where the first humans evolved.

 Antarctica 
Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle. It is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At 14,000,000 square kilometres (5,400,000 square miles), it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. 

About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice. However, there is a large part where the ice does not cover land: the ice shelf|ice shelves. There are important geographical features covered by the ice. The huge Lake Vostok has been covered by ice for at least 15 million years. There is a massive rift valley and a huge mountain range, both of which are covered at present.

 Asia 
Asia is the largest and most populous continent and is a continent in the seven continent system. Asia consists of forty-nine countries as per the United Nations along with many other highly autonomous regions and disputed areas that are often generalised as countries of their own.

Oceania
Several terms are in use to describe the region of Australia and the nations of the Pacific Ocean. The term ''Oceania'' is usually preferred, and this is the term in use by the United Nations. The term ''Pacific Islands'' generally excludes the islands of New Zealand, and the continent of Australia. The indigenous Māori of New Zealand are Polynesian people.

Historically, the region was called ''Australasia''. This term is based more on natural history (geology, and geography) rather than on politics. This term means Australia, New Zealand and the whole of New Guinea, plus those islands which are ''geologically'' connected. 

The countries (14 total) are listed below according to their UN classification:

#Australia - Canberra
#Fiji - Suva
#New Zealand - Wellington
#Federated States of Micronesia - Palikir
#Kiribati - South Tarawa
#Marshall Islands - Majuro
#Nauru - no capital; biggest city is Yaren
#Palau - Ngerulmud
#Papua New Guinea - Port Moresby
#Samoa - Apia
#Solomon Islands - Honiara
#Tonga - Nuku'alofa
#Tuvalu - Funafuti
#Vanuatu - Port Vila

Australasia is not a politically designated region. It is a natural region of ''islands'' designated by its geology, geography, botany, and zoology. It is also an ecozone.
