The '''Dow Jones Industrial Average''' (, also called the '''DJIA''', '''Dow 30''', '''The Dow Jones''' or '''The Dow''') is a stock market index. It was created by Charles Dow, who worked for the ''The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal'' newspaper and later made a new company named Dow Jones & Company.

The stock prices of 30 companies are used to calculate the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The 30 companies are picked by experts who work for Dow Jones. These people pick companies so that the calculated number will represent the general economy of the United States. The rules to pick companies say that all the companies must be from the USA. The rules also say the companies' stocks must be traded on either the New York Stock Exchange|NYSE or the Nasdaq Exchange. 

In the past the companies were all industrial|heavy industries companies and made things like steel, oil, automobile|autos, and appliances. Now the DJIA has many different kinds of companies including some that offer products and services like medicine or software.
