 command set.

Basically, there are two ''topologies'' (ways to do this):
''Arbitrated Loop'': All the devices are connected in a logical bus topology (shown on the right in the picture above). The devices can be connected in a ring much like Token Ring. This avoids using the Fibre Channel Switches, which are very expensive.
''Fabric'' All devices are connected to Fibre Channel Switches. This is similar to Ethernet. It is more expensive though, because Switches that support Fibre Channel are very expensive.
