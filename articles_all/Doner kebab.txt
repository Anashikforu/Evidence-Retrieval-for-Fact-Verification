'''Doner kebab''' (also spelled '''döner kebab''') () is a type of kebab. A doner can be made from lamb, chicken or beef. It is cooked on a vertical rotisserie then thinly sliced. When bought from kebab shops it usually comes with salad or french fries. 

Restaurants in Germany offer hot chili sauce and garlic yoghurt-style sauce.  Barbecue sauce, burger sauce, lemon juice, or a mint sauce similar to Raita (condiment)|raita are also popular. 

There are similar dishes such as the shawarma, Greek gyros, Canadian donair, and Mexican al pastor. Most all Greek gyros include a tangy tzatziki yogurt sauce, french fries, tomatoes and onions while Mexican tacos all pastor are often topped with salsa, onions, cheese (for a few extra pesos – not needed), and pineapple.

Doners are often eaten as take-away food on the way home after a night out. There are several common ways in which doner kebabs are served.

In the UK


Kebabs are very much part of the Friday and Saturday night culture in the UK rather than breakfast or lunchtime food. UK ''doner kebab'' often uses a different mixture of spices, because immigrants from Cyprus run many of the shops. They may offer doner, shish (lamb and chicken) and kofte kebabs, with a 'special' including some of each with bread and French fries|chips.
