A '''first language''' (also '''mother language''', '''mother tongue''', '''native language''', '''arterial language''', or '''L1''') often means the language that a person learns first.

Sometimes, but not often, ''first language'' means the language that a person speaks best (the second language is then spoken less well than the first language, etc.). In that sense, a person could have more than one first or second language.
