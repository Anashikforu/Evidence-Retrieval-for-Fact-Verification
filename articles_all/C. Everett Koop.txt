Today Koop is well known for four parts of his work:

 '''Abortion''': Though Koop did not think abortion was right due to his religion, he did not say anything as to whether abortions done by very skilled medical Medical doctor|doctors were bad for the health of women who the abortions were being done on.
 '''Tobacco''': In 1984 he wrote that nicotine has an addiction|addictiveness like that of heroin or cocaine. People did not think that Koop would say something like this, mainly people who thought he would stay with the views his office had on tobacco products. He also wanted a warning to be mentioned on all cigarette packs, although some of these warnings were there since 1965.
 '''AIDS''': Koop was Surgeon General when AIDS became well known. He wrote the official U.S. policy for AIDS and soon after mailed AIDS information to every U.S. house. Homosexuality|Gays and people who supported them were not happy with how Koop noted gay sex as one of the most likely ways to catch the disease, but Koop would not say he was sorry as he thought gay sex was the greatest risk of getting AIDS.
