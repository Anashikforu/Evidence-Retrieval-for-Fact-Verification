History
Zakarpattia was part of Kingdom of Hungary, later Austria-Hungary until the latter's demise at the end of World War I. This region was briefly part of the short-lived West Ukrainian National Republic in 1918 and occupied by Romania at end of that year. It was later recaptured by Hungary in the summer of 1919. Finally, it joined the newly formed Czechoslovakia as ''Subcarpathian Rus'', of which it formed one of the four main regions, the others being Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia.

During the World War II German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the southern part of the region was awarded to Hungary under the First Vienna Award in 1938.  The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Second Czecho-Slovak Republic. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on March 15, 1939 and the Slovak declaration of an Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state, Ruthenia declared its independence (Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.Subtelny, p. 458

During the German occupation of Hungary in 1944, almost the entire Jewish population was deported; few survived the Holocaust. When the Red Army|Soviet Army crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President Edvard Beneš formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the Soviet Union. It was then incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as ''Zakarpattia Oblast''.

The province has a unique footnote in history as the only region in the former Soviet Union to have had an American governor: its first governor was Gregory Zatkovich, an American citizen who had earlier emigrated from the region and represented the Rusyn community in the U.S.  Zatkovich was appointed governor by Czechoslovakia's first president, Tomáš Masaryk, in 1920 and served for about one year until he resigned over differences regarding the region's autonomy.

After the History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine held an Ukrainian independence referendum, 1991|independence referendum in which the residents of Zakarpattia were asked about the Zakarpattia Oblast Council's proposal for self rule. About 78% of the oblast's population voted in favor of autonomy, however, it was not granted. There were also propositions of separating from Ukraine to rejoin Czechoslovakia,Subtelny, p. 578 but after Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia's dissolution into the Czech Republic and Slovakia on January 1, 1993, these ideas have been rendered largely moot.

On October 25, 2008, delegates to the Congress Of Carpathian Ruthenians declared the formation of the Republic of Carpathian Ruthenia.
