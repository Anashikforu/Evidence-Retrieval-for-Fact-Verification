Physical damage to the brain is called '''traumatic brain injury''' (TBI). It has occurred since ancient times, and old medical records exist.

 History 
Head injuries and their effects were known in ancient times.Boake C. & Diller L 2005. History of rehabilitation for traumatic brain injury. In High W.M. ''et al'' (eds) ''Rehabilitation for traumatic brain injury''. Oxford University Press, p3,8. 

Ancient Mesopotamians knew of head injury and some of its effects, including seizures, paralysis, and loss of sight, hearing or speech.



Perhaps the first reported case of personality change after brain injury is that of Phineas Gage. He survived an accident in 1848 when a large iron rod was driven through his head, destroying at least his left frontal lobe.

He recovered with no apparent sensory system|sensory, movement, or big cognition|cognitive damage. However, his behaviour so altered that friends described him as "no longer being Gage". This suggested that the damaged areas are involved in "higher functions" such as personality.Blair R. 2004. The roles of orbital frontal cortex in the modulation of antisocial behaviour. ''Brain and Cognition'' '''55''' pp. 198â€“208 Many cases of personality change after brain injury have been reported since.

In the 1970s, awareness of TBI as a public health problem grew. A great deal of progress has been made since then in brain trauma research,
