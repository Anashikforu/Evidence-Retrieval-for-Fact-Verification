'''Flavia Julia Helena''' (). Helena was a wife or concubine of Constantius I before he became a Roman emperor. In Christianity, Helena is a saint because Christian historians during Late Antiquity wrote that she found the relics of the True Cross in Jerusalem. Helena's tomb was the Mausoleum of Helena outside Rome.
