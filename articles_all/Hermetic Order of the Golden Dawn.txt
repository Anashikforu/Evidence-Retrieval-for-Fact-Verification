The '''Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn''' (or '''Golden Dawn''' for short) was a magical order of secret society for the study of the occult and metaphysics. It was founded in London in 1888 by Dr. William Wynn Westcott and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers. It ceased to exist under that name in 1903. However, two spin-off groups were created at that time, the Stella Matutina and the Alpha et Omega.

While it was popular, many well-known people joined the Golden Dawn. Some of its members included:
 Algernon Blackwood
 Aleister Crowley
 Florence Farr
 Dion Fortune
 Arthur Machen
 Pamela Colman Smith
 Arthur Edward Waite
 William Butler Yeats
