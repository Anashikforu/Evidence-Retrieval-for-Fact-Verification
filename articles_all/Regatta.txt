A '''regatta''' is a term used to describe either a boat race, or series of boat races. 

Although the term typically describes racing events of unpowered watercraft, some powerboat race series are also called ''regattas''.  Most commonly, a ''regatta'' is either a series of rowing (sport)|rowing, sailing or yacht racing.

Although ''regattas'' are typically amateur competitions, they are usually very highly organized, formally structured events, with complex rules precisely describing the schedule and procedures of the event.
