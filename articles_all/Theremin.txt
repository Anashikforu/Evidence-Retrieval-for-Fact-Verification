The '''Theremin''' , Its invention grew out of a search for ways to detect movement. It was the first musical instrument to be played without being touched. The control section has two metal Antenna (radio)|antennae to sense the positions of the player's hands. One hand controls the pitch (music)|pitch. The other hand controls the loudness|volume. To play the theremin, the player moves his hands around the two metal antennas. The electric Signal (electrical engineering)|signals from the theremin are amplifier|amplified and sent to a loudspeaker.

The sound of the theremin is associated with "alien," surreal, and eerie-sounding portamento, glissando, tremolo, and vibrato sounds. It has been used in film soundtracks such as ''Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound'', ''The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend'', ''Ed Wood'', ''Mars Attacks!'' and ''The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still''. The BBC Radiophonic Workshop used the theramin to provide the electronic sounds in demand in the mid-century. Theremins are also used in art music (especially Experimental music|avant-garde and 20th century "new music") and in popular music genres such as rock music|rock and pop music|pop. The Russian Dmitri Shostakovich was one of the first to include parts for the theremin in orchestral pieces, including a use in his score for the 1931 film ''Odna''.
