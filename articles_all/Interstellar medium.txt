In astronomy, the '''interstellar medium''' (sometimes called the '''ISM''') is the tenuous gas and dust that fills the Void (astronomy)|void between Stellar system|stellar systems in galaxies, that consisting mainly of huge clouds of ionized, neutral, or Molecular cloud|molecular hydrogen. This gas and dust not distributed uniformly in interstellar space, but displays significant variations in density, temperature, and ionization|ionisation state.

Various gases exist in outer space. Most common are hydrogen and helium. Interstellar cosmic dust makes nebulae.
