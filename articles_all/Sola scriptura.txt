'''''Sola scriptura''''' (Latin for "by scripture alone") means "The Bible only". Protestants believe that they should only read the Bible to find out what God wants. They do this instead of listening to the Pope or the Roman Catholic Church.

''Sola scriptura'' was a principle of the Protestant Reformation of the reformer Martin Luther and is a principle of Protestants today (see Five solas).
