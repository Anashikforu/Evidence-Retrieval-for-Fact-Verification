 Twelve Apostles 
According to the list occurring in each of the Synoptic Gospels (), the '''Twelve''' chosen by Jesus near the beginning of his ministry, those whom ''also He named Apostles'', were
Saint Peter|Simon: called Peter (Grk. petros; Aram. kēfas; Engl. stone) by Jesus of Nazareth, also known as Simon bar Jonah and Simon bar Jochanan (Aram.) and earlier (Pauline Epistles were written first) Cephas (Aram.), and Simon Peter, a fisherman from Bethsaida "of Galilee" (John 1:44; cf. 12:21) Simon/Peter - Andrew's brother (Matthew 10:2; Mark 3:16; Luke 6:14)
Saint Andrew|Andrew: brother of Peter, a Bethsaida fisherman and disciple of John the Baptist, and also the First-Called Apostle. (Matthew 10:2; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:14)
James, son of Zebedee|James - John's brother, son of Zebedee, Boanerges, son of Thunder (Matthew 10:2; Mark 3:17; Luke 6:14)
John the Apostle|John son of Zebedee, called by Jesus Boanerges(an Aramaic name explained in Mk 3:17 as "Sons of Thunder") - James' brother (Matthew 10:2; Mark 3:17; Luke 6:14)
 Known as the only apostle who was not martyred, and also has his own Gospel in the New Testament.
Philip the Apostle|Philip: from Bethsaida "of Galilee" (John 1:44, 12:21) (Matthew 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:14)
Thaddeus: "Judas, son of James", (Matthew 10:3, Acts 1:13, Luke 6:16, John 14:22). Lebbaeus/Judas/Juda - , Simon's brother (Matthew 10:3; 13:55; Mark 3:18; 6:3; Luke 6:16; Jude 1:1)
Bartholomew: in Aramaic "bar-Talemai?", "son of Talemai" or from Ptolemais, some identify with Nathanael. (Matthew 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:14)
Thomas (Apostle)|Thomas: also known as ''Judas Tomas Didymus'' - Aramaic ''T'oma'' = ''twin'', and Greek ''Didymous'' = ''twin (Matthew 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15)''
James the Just|James: commonly identified with James the Less Saint Matthew|Matthew: the tax collector, some identify with Levi son of Alphaeus - Levi - James' brother (James the less) (Matthew 10:3; 27:56; Mark 2:14; 3:16, 18; 6:3; 15:40, 47; Luke 5:27; 6:14-15; 24:18; Acts 1:13; 4:36) and author of the Book of Matthew
 Simon the Canaanite: called in Luke and Acts "Simon the Zealot", some identify with Simeon of JerusalemJudas Iscariot: the name Iscariot may refer to the Judaean towns of Kerioth or to the sicarii (Jewish nationalist insurrectionists), or to the tribe of Issachar; (Matthew 10:4; Mark 3:19; Luke 6:16)
 He was replaced as an apostle in Acts by Saint Matthias


It should also be noted that while the "Twelve Apostles" refer to the twelve who followed Jesus during his lifetime (and later Matthias in place of Judas Iscariot), Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus) can be considered as another apostle. Notably, he begins many of his epistles with "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus", or some variant. The original twelve were apostles sent out to the Jews, whereas Paul has the unique role of being the apostle to the gentiles after Christ's resurrection and ascent.

The identity of the other apostle of the twelve, traditionally called St. Jude, varies between the Synoptic Gospels and also between ancient manuscripts of each gospel:
 Mark names him as Saint Jude|Thaddaeus
 Some manuscripts of Matthew also identify him as Thaddeus
 Some manuscripts of Matthew name him as ''Lebbaeus''
 Some manuscripts of Matthew name him as Judas the Zealot
 Luke names him as Epistle of Jude|Judas, son of James or in the KJV: "Judas the brother of James" 

The Gospel of John, unlike the Synoptic Gospels, does not offer a formal list of apostles, but does refer to the ''Twelve'' in . The following nine apostles are identified by name:
 Peter
 Andrew (identified as Peter's brother)
''the sons of Zebedee'' (plural form implies at least two apostles)
 Philip
 Thomas (also called Didymus ())
 Judas Iscariot
''Judas (not Iscariot)'' ()

The individual that the Gospel of John names as Nathanael is traditionally identified as the same person that the Synoptic Gospels call Bartholomew, and most would agree that the ''sons of Zebedee'' is likely to be a reference to James and John, while ''Judas (not Iscariot)'' probably refers to Thaddaeus, also known as St. Jude. Noticeably missing from the Gospel of John are James, son of Alphaeus, Matthew, and Simon the Canaanite/Zealot.
