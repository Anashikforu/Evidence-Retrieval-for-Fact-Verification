'''Mysticism''' is the belief that people can ''directly'' experience God or true reality, rather than through books, ritual or other people. People who practice this are called ''mystics''.

Mystics exist within most religions, though not all people who practice religions are mystics. Mystics may experience visions or dreams, or hear God as a voice.
