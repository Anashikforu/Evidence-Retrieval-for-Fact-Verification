The '''Asiatic lion''' (''Panthera leo persica'') is a subspecies of the lion. It survives today only in India, where it is also known as the Indian lion. They once ranged from Southeast Europe to India, covering most of Southwest Asia, and hence it is also known as the Persian lion. The Asiatic lion has a cinnamon colour coat. Only 350 Asiatic lions are left in Asia. They all live in the Gir Forest in the Indian state of Gujarat. It was the state animal of Junagadh State.
