The '''Extremaduran language''' () is the native language of Northwestern province of Cáceres. About 150,000 people speak it in Extremadura. This language is very similar to Leonese language and Asturian or Bable, spoken in other territories that once made up the Kingdom of León. Is called ''artu estremeñu'' (High extremaduran) too. Central and Low Extremaduran (''Meyu estremeñu'' and ''Bahu estremeñu'') are Spanish dialects with Extremaduran influences.
