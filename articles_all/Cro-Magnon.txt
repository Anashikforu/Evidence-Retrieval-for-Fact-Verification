The earliest known '''Cro-Magnon''' remains are between 35,000 and 45,000 years old,

Cro-Magnons had powerful bodies, which were usually heavy and solid with strong muscles.  Unlike Neanderthals, which had slanted foreheads, the Cro-Magnons had straight foreheads, like modern humans.  Their faces were short and wide with a large chin.  Their brains were slightly larger than the average human's is today.Stringer C. 2012. What makes a modern human. ''Nature'' '''485''' (7396): 33â€“35. 
Naming
The name "Cro-Magnon" was created by Louis Lartet, who discovered the first Cro-Magnon skull in southwestern France in 1868.  He called the place where he found the skull ''Abri de Cro-Magnon.''    Basically, Cro-Magnon means "rock shelter in a hole on Magnon's land."

This is why scientists now use the term "European early modern humans" instead of "Cro-Magnons."  In taxonomy, the term "Cro-Magnon" means nothing.

Cro-Magnon life

Like most early humans, the Cro-Magnons mostly hunting|hunted large animals.  For example, they killed mammoths, cave bears, horses, and reindeer for food.  They hunted with spears, javelins, and spear-throwers.  They also ate fruits from plants.

The Cro-Magnons were nomadic people|nomadic or semi-nomadic.  This means that instead of living in just one place, they followed the migration of the animals they wanted to hunt.  They may have built hunting camps from mammoth bones; some of these camps were found in a village in Ukraine.  They also made shelters from rocks, clay, tree branches, and animal skin (leather).
