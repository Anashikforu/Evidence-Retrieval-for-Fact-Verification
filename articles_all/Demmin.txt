 World War II 
Wehrmacht|German troops destroyed the bridges over the Peene while retreating from Demmin during World War II.

During that night and the following morning, Demmin was handed over to the Red Army largely without fighting, similar to other cities like Greifswald.

Although there were only a few pockets of resistance, nearly 900 people committed suicide|mass suicides in fear of the Red Army. Coroner lists show that most drowned in the nearby River Tollense and River Peene, where others poisoned themselves.
