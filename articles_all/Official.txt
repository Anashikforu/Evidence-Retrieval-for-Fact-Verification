The term ''officer'' is close to having the same meaning as "official" (but has more military connotations). A ''functionary'' is someone who carries out a particular role within an organisation—this is quite a close synonym for an official but with connotations closer to a ''bureaucrat''. A ''civil servant'' can also have a similar meaning to an official.
