Sales certificates
The British Phonographic Industry awards certificates for music releases in United Kingdom|Britain. The level of the award varies depending on the format of the release and the number sold. BPI certificates are not automatic; the record company must pay a fee to the BPI and they carry out an audit into the release in question. Certificates are usually awarded on the basis of the number of units the release has shipped, rather than the number it has sold.
