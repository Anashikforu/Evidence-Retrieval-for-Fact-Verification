'''Colonization''' is the act of one country settling another place, in order to become the new rulers of the new country, and to live in the new country. An early example is the settlers who went from the cities of Ancient Greece to start new cities.

Because of this, and the killing of many Native Americans, most people now living in North America are the descendents of Europeans.
