In Major League Baseball (MLB), the '''500 home run club''' is a term given to the group of Batting (baseball)|batters who have hit 500 or more regular-season home runs in their careers. On August 11, 1929, Babe Ruth became the first member of the club. Ruth ended his career with 714 home runs.  This record stood from 1935 until Hank Aaron broke it in 1974. Twenty-six players are members of the 500 home run club.

Of these 26 players, 14 were right-handed batters, 10 were left-handed, and 2 were switch hitters (meaning they could bat from either side of the plate). The San Francisco Giants are the only franchise to have four players reach 500 home runs while on their roster: Mel Ott while History of the New York Giants (NL)|the team was in New York, Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, and most recently Bonds. Four 500 home run club members—Aaron, Mays, Eddie Murray, and Rafael Palmeiro—are also members of the 3,000 hit club. Sheffield's 500th home run was his first career home run with the New York Mets, the first time that a player's 500th home run was also his first with his franchise.

Being a member of the 500 home run club is sometimes described as a guarantee of entry into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame.  Some believe the milestone has become less meaningful in recent years.
