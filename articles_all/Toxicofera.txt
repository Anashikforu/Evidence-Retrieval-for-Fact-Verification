'''Toxicofera''' (Greek or Latin for "those who carry toxins"), is a Hypothesis|hypothetical clade of living Squamata (lizards and snakes). It includes about 4600 living species. This is all Poison|venomous reptile species, plus related non-venomous species.


The clade was identified when research showed that the evolution of venom was very ancient, and that it might have occurred only once.
