'''Matrixism''' or '''The path of the One''' is a new religion based on the movie ''The Matrix''.Bouma, Gary (2007). Australian Soul, Cambridge University Press. 

Matrixism is a syncretic religion (a religion that joins together all religions). The words "the matrix" are seen in a Baha'i book from the year 1912 named "The Promulgation (starting) of Universal (complete international) Peace".Kohn, Rachael. ''The Spirit of Things'', Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio National, August 20, 2006.

Matrixism has four beliefs called "The Four Tenets (rules) of Matrixism". The four rules are; 1) Belief in the prophecy of the One. 2) Use of psychedelics (mind expansion medicine) as sacrament. 3) Seeing the relative nature of the world. 4) Acting by the rules of one of the world's religions.Sam Jordison|Jordison, Sam (2005). ''The Joy of Sects: An A-Z of Cults, Cranks and Religious Eccentrics: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sects But Were Afraid to Ask'', pp 127–9, Robson Books.  For Matrixism April 19th is a holiday (special day) named Bicycle Day. November 22nd is another holiday for Matrixism named the Day of Remembrance and Reflection. Aldous Huxley, John F. Kennedy and C.S. Lewis all died on this day in 1963.

The sign for Matrixism is 赤, the Japanese kanji for the word "red". This sign was used in the computer game ''Enter the Matrix''. The color is a reference to the "red pill", from the motion picture ''The Matrix'', which is representative of being able to see that which is true. The word (sign) 赤 is also a Chinese word (character). In fact, the Japanese kanji is from a Chinese character.
