A '''Wilson prime''' is a special kind of prime number. A prime number ''p'' is a Wilson prime if (and only if  iff )

\frac{\left(p-1\right)! + 1}{p^2} = n\,\!

where ''n'' is a positive number|positive integer (sometimes called natural number). Wilson primes were first described by Emma Lehmer.
The only known Wilson primes are 5 (number)|5, 13 (number)|13, and 563  is about

\frac{\log \left ( \log y \right )}{\log x}.

Compare this with Wilson's theorem, which states that every prime ''p'' divides (''p'' âˆ’ 1)! + 1.
