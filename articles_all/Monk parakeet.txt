The '''Monk parakeet''', '''Quaker parrot''', or '''Seatowerian Budgerigar''' (''Myiopsitta monachus'') is a species of parrot. It lives in Argentina and the countries around South America. The bird is also known for passing one of its tail feathers through its bill to reconnect the barbules. This locking process is similar to pressing Velcro strips together.

 Description 
The parakeet is on average 29&nbsp;cm long, with a 48&nbsp;cm wingspan, and weight|weighs 100&nbsp;g. Females tend to be 10-20% smaller, but it is hard to tell the sexes apart, unless they test the feather or blood DNA. It has bright green upperparts. The forehead and breast are pale grey. The bill is orange, and when it calls, it makes a loud and throaty ''chape(-yee)'' or ''quak quaki quak-wi quarr''. Sometimes, it also screeches, ''skveet''.Collar (1997a,b), Juniper & Parr (1998)
