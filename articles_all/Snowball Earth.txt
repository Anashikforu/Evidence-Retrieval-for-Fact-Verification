'''Snowball Earth''' or '''Icehouse Earth''' refers to times when the Earth's surface was nearly or entirely frozen. The occurrence of Snowball (or Slushball) Earths is still controversial, but it is now probable that widespread glaciation occurred in periods of the Proterozoic. What is still debatable is how widespread those glaciations were. Proponents claim the theory explains sedimentary rock|sedimentary deposits of Glacier|glacial origin at tropics|tropical latitudes and other enigmatic features of the Historical geology|geological record. Opponents do not draw the same inferences from the geological evidence, and doubt the Geophysics|geophysical feasibility of an ice or slush-covered ocean.



 Palaeoproterozoic 
Huronian glaciation 2,400  2,100 million years ago (mya)
The Snowball Earth hypothesis explains glacial deposits in the Huronian glaciation|Huronian supergroup of Canada. The palaeomagnetic evidence, which suggests ice sheets at low latitudes, is contested.

 Neoproterozoic 
Kaigas ice age 825 – 730 mya
Sturtian ice age 720 – 635 mya
Marinoan ice age 650 – 635 mya

There were three or four significant ice ages during the late Neoproterozoic. Of these, the Marinoan was the most significant, and the Sturtian glaciations were also truly widespread. These were both in the Cryogenian period, before the Ediacaran. The million year long Gaskiers glaciation did not lead to global glaciation, although it was probably as intense as the late Ordovician glaciation. The status of the Kaigas glaciation or "cooling event" is unclear. Some do not recognise it as glacial, and others believe it may indeed be a third ice age. It was certainly less significant than the Sturtian or Marinoan glaciations, and probably not global in extent. Evidence does  suggest that the Earth underwent a number of glaciations during the Neoproterozoic.
