A '''shape''' is a geometry|geometric wikt:figure|figure that can be described with mathematics. One way to classify shapes is to describe a bigger kind of shape that the shape is one of. For example, they can be classified by their different numbers of dimensions. Thus, circles are two-dimensional shapes so, like other 2D shapes, they will fit into a flat Plane (mathematics)|plane.

Three-dimensional objects like cubes will not fit inside a plane, because they are not flat. 4D|Four-dimensional shapes made of polygons are called polychorons, and shapes made of polygons of any dimension are polytopes.

Two shapes are said to be equal, if one can be changed into the other by rotation|turning, moving, growing, shrinking, or more than one of these in combination. Geometry is one of the practical sections of mathematics which involves various shapes and sizes of different figures and their properties.

 2D shapes 
 circle

square (geometry)|square
rectangle
octagon
heptagon
hexagon
pentagon
decagon
nonagon
heptadecagon

These are 2D|two-dimensional shapes or flat Plane (mathematics)|plane geometry shapes. Their sides are made of straight or curved lines. They can have any number of sides. Plane figures made of lines are called polygons. Triangles and squares are examples of polygons.
