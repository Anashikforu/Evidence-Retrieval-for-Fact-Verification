The '''kea''' (''Nestor notabilis'') is a large parrot bird.  It lives in forests and high rocky hills on the South Island of New Zealand. It is mostly olive-green in color and has a large narrow curved grey-brown upper beak. The kea is the only parrot in the world that lives in alpine habitats.

Kea are intelligent and curios.  People think this may help them survive in the mountains.

Kea like playing with human objects. They like to tear the rubber off car windows and moving around traffic cones.
