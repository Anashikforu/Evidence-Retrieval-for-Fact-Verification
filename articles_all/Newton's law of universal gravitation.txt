'''Newton's universal law of gravitation''' is a physical law that describes the attraction between two objects with mass. It is talked about in Isaac Newton's ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica''. The law is part of classical mechanics. 

The formula is

F_{g} = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2},



In this equation:
  is the total gravitational force between the two objects.
  is the gravitational constant.
  is the mass of the first object.
  is the mass of the second object.
  is the distance between the centers of the objects.
