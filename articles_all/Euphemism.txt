'''Euphemism''' is the use of a word (or phrase) that replaces another one that one thinks to be too offensive or vulgar.
It also may be a replacement of a name or a word, that could reveal a secret or holy and sacred names to the Initiation|uninitiated. It may also be used to obscure the identity of the subject of a conversation from potential eavesdropper|eavesdroppers. A well known example for many is the replacement of ''Lord Voldemort's'' name by "You-Know-Who" or "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named" in Harry Potter. Some euphemisms are intended to be humorous.

 Usage 
When a phrase is used as a euphemism, it often becomes a metaphor whose literal meaning is dropped. Euphemisms may be used to hide unpleasant or disturbing ideas, even when the literal term for them is not necessarily offensive. This type of euphemism is used in politics.
