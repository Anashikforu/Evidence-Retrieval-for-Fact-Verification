'''Ionization''' is the physics|physical process of giving or taking away electrons from an atom. That makes the atom into an ion, because ions have Electric charge|electrical charge. 

In the process of ionization, an electric charge|electrically neutral atom becomes either positively or negatively charged. Some substance|substances are easier to ionize than others. This depends on the ionization energy. Ionizing radiation is a common cause, but ionization can also be done artificially.
