'''Publishing''' is  making information available for public view. A publisher makes and sells literature or information. Publishers can pay their authors, or authors who want to be published can pay the publisher. Sometimes authors are their own publishers.

Traditionally, publishing means the creation and distribution of printed works such as books and newspapers. Since the late 20th century it can also mean internet publishing.

A '''publication''' is the product of publishing.
