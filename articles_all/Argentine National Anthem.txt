The lyrics of the '''Himno Nacional Argentino''' (the national anthem of Argentina) were written by Vicente LÃ³pez y Planes, and the music was composed by Blas Parera. This song was adopted as the national anthem on May 11, 1813, three years before the formal declaration of independence from Spain. May 11 is therefore ''Anthem Day'' in Argentina.

 Modern Version 
The following is the modern version, adopted in 1900, without the vivid attacks against Spain.
