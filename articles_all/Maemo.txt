 maemo SDK 
The maemo SDK is based around the Debian-oriented Scratchbox|Scratchbox Cross Compilation Toolkit, which provides a  Sandbox (software development)|sandbox environment in which development may take place. Scratchbox uses Qemu to emulate an ARMEL processor or sbrsh to remotely execute instructions. Scratchbox-compatible rootstraps are available for both x86 and Armel|ARMEL, so the majority of development and debugging takes place on x86, with final packaging being for ARMEL.
