'''A-type asteroids''' are fairly uncommon closer asteroids that have a strong, broad 1 micrometre|µm olivine feature and a very reddish spectrum shortwards of 0.7 µm. They are thought to come from the completely differentiated Mantle (geology)|mantle of an asteroid.

A-type asteroids are so rare that as of 2005 only 17 had been found.
