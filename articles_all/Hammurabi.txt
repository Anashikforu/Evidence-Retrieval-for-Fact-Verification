 History 

Hammurabi became king of Babylon in around 1792 BC, when his father Sin-Muballit abdicated. 

Hammurabi did not fight any important wars in the early part of his reign. He instead improved the buildings of Babylon. He built taller city walls to make the city more difficult to attack, and expanded the temples.

Hammurabi's allies in northern Mesopotamia had sent their armies to the south to help Babylon. This caused unrest in the northern area.  Hammurabi therefore returned north, stopping the unrest, and defeating Eshnunna.
