The term '''Ecclesiastical Latin''' (sometimes called '''Church Latin''' or '''Italian Latin''') means the Latin language that is used in documents of the Roman Catholic Church and in its Latin liturgy|liturgies. It is not a distinct language but a form of Latin used for ecclesiastical purposes because the same language can be used also for commercial or other purposes.

The Church issued the dogma|dogmatic definitions of the first seven ecumenical council|General Councils in Greek language|Greek, and even in Rome, Greek remained at first the language of the liturgy and the language in which the first popes wrote. The Holy See is not obliged to use Latin as its official language, and in theory, it could change its practice.

However, Latin has the advantage that the meaning of its words is less likely to change radically over the centuries. That helps to ensure theology|theological precision and orthodoxy.  Accordingly, recent Popes have reaffirmed the importance of Latin for the Church, particularly for those in ecclesiastical studies.
