'''''Arabidopsis thaliana''''' is a small flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is widely used as a model organism in plant genetics. Arabidopsis is a member of the mustard (''Brassicaceae'') family, which includes cultivated species such as cabbage and radish. 

It was the first plant genome to be DNA sequencing|sequenced, completed in 2000 by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative. 

Much work has been done to find out what its 27,000 genes and 35,000 proteins do.
''Arabidopsis'' is a popular tool for understanding the molecular biology of many plant Trait (biology)|traits, including flower development and phototropism|light sensing.
