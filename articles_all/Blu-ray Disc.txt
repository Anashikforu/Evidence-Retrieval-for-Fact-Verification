'''Blu-ray Disc''' is a high-density optical disc format similar to DVD.  Blu-ray is the type of disc used for Playstation 3|PlayStation 3 games and for playing high-definition (HD) movies.  In the past, there were other standards for such movies, such as the HD DVD format.  Blu-ray won what is called the ''format war''. 

A dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store up to 50GB (gigabytes) of data. This is over five times the capacity of a DVD, and over 70 times more than a Compact disc|CD or VCD.

The disc was developed by the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA), a group of consumer electronics, personal computer and media manufacturers, and released in 2006.  The format was developed for recording, rewriting and playback of high-definition video (HD), as well as storing large amounts of data.

Older optical disc technologies such as DVD, DVD±R, DVD±RW, and DVD-RAM used a red laser to read and write data.  The new format used a blu laser instead.  This is where the name is from.
