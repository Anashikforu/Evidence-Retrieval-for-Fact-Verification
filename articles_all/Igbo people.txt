The '''Igbo people''' (Igbo: ''' Ṇ́dị́ Ìgbò''') are an ethnic group in West Africa. They are one of the largest ethnic groups in West Africa. The Igbo speak the Igbo language (Igbo: ''Ásụ̀sụ̀ Ị̀gbò''). The Igbo people are found in Southeastern Nigeria, in an area referred to as Igboland (Igbo: ''Àlà Ị̀gbò''). There are some Igbos in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. 

There are major amounts of Igbo people found in other countries that are not in Africa. This is because some Igbos have moved to other countries and because they were forced to go to other countries by the Atlantic slave trade. 

They are in countries such as the United States, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Barbados, Bahamas, and the United Kingdom. The most important crop of the Igbo people is the yam. In Nigeria, the Igbo have a lot of cities, like Onitsha and Enugu.
