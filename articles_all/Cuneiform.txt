'''Cuneiform script''' is one of the earliest known writing system|systems of writing.Egyptian hieroglyphs also have a claim, and it is unsettled which system began first. 
It was first used in Sumer in the late 4th millennium BC (the 'Uruk IV' period). Cuneiform writing began as a system of pictogram|pictographs. In the third millennium, the signs became simplified and more abstract. Fewer characters were used, from about 1,000 in the early Bronze Age to about 400 in late Bronze Age (Hittite cuneiform). The system  used a combination of phonetic, consonantal alphabetic (no vowels) and syllable|syllabic signs.


The original Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the Akkadian language|Akkadian, Eblaite, Elamite, Hittite, Luwian, Hattic, Hurrian, and Urartian language|Urartian languages, and it inspired the Ugaritic and Old Persian alphabets. Cuneiform writing was gradually replaced by the Phoenician alphabet during the Neo-Assyrian Empire. By the 2nd century BC, the script was extinct. All knowledge of how to read it was lost until it began to be deciphered in the 19th century.
