'''Thyreophora''' is a suborder of ornithischian dinosaurs. They were the '''armoured dinosaurs''': the name means 'shield-bearer'. They are divided into these groups:
Various early bipedal herbivores, lightly armoured: ''Scutellosaurus'', ''Scelidosaurus''.
 Ankylosauria
Ankylosaurids: armoured from their head to their club-ended tail.
Nodosaurids: no tail club but spikes and bony bumps on body.
 Stegosauria
Stegosaurids: small heads and vertical plates and spines on body and tail. Upper Jurassic, Lower Cretaceous.
Huayangosaurids: early group from Middle Jurassic of China.




''Acanthopholis'' was 15 feet long, walked on four legs, lived in the Lower Cretaceous). Its armour consists of many oval plates that go from its neck to its tail. That lived 100 million yeas ago. The name 'spiny scales' refers to its armour.
