The '''Nintendo 64DD''' (DD meaning '''Disk Drive''') was a magnetic disk add-on for the Nintendo 64. It was considered too late in the History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth generation and commercial failure|flopped on its release in Japan in 1999. When it came out, the Dreamcast had already been released and soon for Nintendo fans the GameCube was developed with a built-in Compact disc|CD drive. For these reasons, it was unsuccessful, and only few games were ever released for it. The console was released only in Japan and it was discontinued in February 2001. Games such as ''Super Mario 64 2'' (the sequel to Nintendo 64's 1996 game, ''Super Mario 64'') were planned, but were cancelled. Instead, in 2004, an enhanced Nintendo DS remake called ''Super Mario 64 DS'' and was released the same day as the Nintendo DS|original ''DS'' and featured more characters, more stars, and better graphics. Only four Super Mario|''Mario'' games were released on the 64 Disk Drive, all from the ''Mario Artist'' series.
