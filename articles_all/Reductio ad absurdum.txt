'''''Reductio ad absurdum''''' is a Latin language|Latin phrase which means "reduction to the absurd". The phrase describes a kind of indirect proof. It is a proof by wikt:contradiction|contradiction, It is a way of reasoning that has been used throughout the history of mathematics and philosophy from classical antiquity onwards.

The wikt:ridiculous|ridiculous or "''absurdum''" conclusion of a ''reductio ad absurdum'' argument can have many forms. For example,
 Rocks have weight, otherwise we would see them floating in the air.
 Society must have laws, otherwise there would be chaos.
There is no smallest positive rational number, because if there were, it could be divided by two to get a smaller one.

 History 
The phrase can be traced back to the Greek language|Greek ''η εις  άτοπον απαγωγή'' (''hê eis átopon apagogê''). This phrase means "reduction to the impossible". It was often used by Aristotle.Heath, Thomas Little 1908. 
Method
''Reduction ad absurdum'' can be a tool of discovery.Polya, Goerge. (2008).  
The method of proving something works by first assuming something about it. Then other things are deduced from that. If there is a contradiction, it shows that the first something cannot be correct.  For example, 

:To prove '''A''' is wikt:true|true, wikt:correct|correct, wikt:valid|valid, wikt:credible|credible ....
::Assume the opposite --  that "not-'''A'''" is true....
::Assume that if "not-'''A'''" is true, then it must mean or wikt:imply|imply '''B'''.
::Show that '''B''' is wikt:false|false, wikt:incorrect|incorrect, wikt:invalid|invalid, wikt:incredible|incredible ...
:Therefore, '''A''' must be true after all.
