'''Hominini''' is the tribe of Homininae|african apes that comprises humans (''Homo''), and all ancestors of ''Homo sapiens'' back to the split from the apes. This branching is now dated at five to eight million years ago, with ''Sahelanthropus'' as a key fossil.Wood B. 2010. Reconstructing human evolution: achievements, challenges, and opportunities. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' '''107''': 8902–8909. 
A less frequent usage includes the two species present-day of the genus ''Chimpanzee|Pan'' (the common chimpanzee and the bonobo). In this case, the subtribe Hominina is the "human" branch, including genus ''Homo (genus)|Homo'' and its close relatives, but not ''Pan''. All species in this tribe carry the same four blood-types which can be exchanged between species.

It highlights the subfamily Homininae. First the gibbons (Hylobatidae) split from the main line some 18 million years ago. Next, the subfamily Ponginae broke away—leading to the current orangutan. Later the Homininae split into the tribe Hominini (with subtribes Hominina and Panina), and the tribe Gorilla|Gorillini
