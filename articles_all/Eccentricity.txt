 

'''Eccentricity''' or '''extravagance''' is a word used to describe unusual behaviour in a person. People who have habits which many people think are very strange may be called '''eccentric'''. Eccentric behaviour is not necessarily good or bad in itself.

Eccentric people are always better known by their eccentricities. Explained to be an unusually odd behavior, eccentricity tends to reflect from various aspects of a human personality. There is no definition to classifying someone as ‘eccentric’, and neither is there a limit to the very many facets of individual expression which may get labeled as eccentric. It is neither insanity nor a disorder.

Some clever people (geniuses) have behaviour which might be described as eccentric. It is not always clear whether behaviour is just eccentric or whether it is madness. 

Famous people who were eccentric in their different ways include Albert Einstein, Nero, Alan Turing, Howard Hughes, Ludwig II of Bavaria and Lord Berners.
