The '''Bucegi Mountains''' () are in central Romania to the south of the city Bra≈üov. They are part of the Southern Carpathians group of the Carpathian Mountains of Europe.
To the east, the Bucegi Mountains have a very steep slope. This is towards the popular tourist destination Prahova Valley. At a higher elevation is the Bucegi Plateau, where wind and rain have turned the rock (geology)|rocks into brilliant figures such as the Sphinx (Romania)|Sphinx and ''Babele''.

The Bucegi is thought to be the Dacian holy mountain ''Kogainon''. Here, the mythical figure Zalmoxis resided in a cave.
