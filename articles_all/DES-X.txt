In cryptography, '''DES-X''' (or '''DESX''') is an alternative to the Data Encryption Standard|DES (Data Encryption Standard) block cipher designed to increase the complexity of a brute force attack using a technique called ''key whitening''. As Data Encryption Standard|DES suffers from brute force attack '''DES-X''' was a trial to overcome such drawbacks.
