'''White nose syndrome''' ('''WNS''') is a condition which has caused many bats in the United States and Canada to die. The condition is named ''white nose'' because the affected bats have a fungus around their nose which is white. It was discovered in February 2006.

The disease was first reported in January 2007 in some New York caves.
