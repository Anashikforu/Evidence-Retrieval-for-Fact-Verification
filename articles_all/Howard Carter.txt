'''Howard Carter''' (May 9, 1874 â€“ March 2, 1939) was an England|English archaeologist. His mother was Martha Carter and his father was Samuel Carter. As a young man he worked for the Egyptian Antiquities Service. Later, he was the man who found King Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922. 

The discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb was an accident. Howard Carter's waterboy stumbled across some steps leading under the desert surface. Lord Carnarvon, a sponsor of Carter's work, was impatient of the slow progress at this point, and if the discovery had not been made, then it likely would not have been discovered at all.
