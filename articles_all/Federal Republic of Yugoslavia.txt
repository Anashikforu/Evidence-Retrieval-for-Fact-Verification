The '''Federal Republic of Yugoslavia''' ( / ''Savezna Republika Jugoslavija'') or '''FRY''' was a federal state constructed by the republics of Republic of Serbia (federal)|Serbia and Republic of Montenegro (federal)|Montenegro. They were parts of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) where the majority of the people were Serbs. The new federation was created after the other four republics broke away from Yugoslavia amid rising ethnic attacks, war and tension. The state existed from 1992 to 2002, when it was reconstituted as a State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. It existed for three years until a referendum for independence in Montenegro resulted in the majority of Montenegrins supporting separation from Serbia. This resulted in both Montenegro and Serbia becoming different countries.
