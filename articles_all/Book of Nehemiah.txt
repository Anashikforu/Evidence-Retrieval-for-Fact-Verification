The '''Book of Nehemiah''' is a book of the Hebrew Bible, thought to be a continuation of the Book of Ezra, and is sometimes called the second book of Ezra. It is thought to be written by Nehemiah. It is about the return from exile and the rebuilding of Jerusalem. The Book talks about the struggles the Israelites face, such as when they rebuild the walls of the city, non-Israelite people are angry. Another problem is the fact that people are not obeying Jewish law.
