'''Rolex''' is a Swiss company that makes watches and additional things for their watches.  Their watches are often used as a status symbol. The watches are also often counterfeited, meaning people make fake watches that look like Rolexes, but are not.
It was founded in 1905 by Hans Wilsdorf and Alfred Davis in London, England. The original name of the company was Wilsdorf and Davis, and in 1919, operations were relocated to Geneva, Switzerland. The brand today produces industry icons such as the Rolex Submariner, Daytona, and GMT-Master, and competes with other leading luxury watch companies like Patek Philippe, Omega SA|Omega, and Panerai and sponsors many major sports events in tennis, golf, yachting, and racing.
Rolex founder Hans Wildorf, famously gave swimmer Mercedes Gleitze one of the earliest Rolex Oysters to wear in her attempt to repeat her swim across the English Channel. After 10 hours in icy cold water, her Rolex was still dry inside.
