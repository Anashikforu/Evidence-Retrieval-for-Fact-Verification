'''BookCrossing''' (also: '''BC''', '''BCing''' or '''BXing''') is defined as "the practice of leaving a book in a public place to be picked up and read by others, who then do :wikt:likewise|likewise." The term comes from bookcrossing.com, a free online book club which began in order to further the practice, with the goal to "make the whole world a library."

The 'crossing' or :wikt:exchanging|exchanging of books may take many different forms, including wild releasing books in public, direct swaps with other members of the website, or "book rings" in which books travel in a set order to people who want to read that book. The community aspect of BookCrossing.com has grown in ways that were not expected at the start, in the form of blog or forum discussions, mailing lists and yearly :wikt:convention|conventions all over the world.

 History 
Ron Hornbaker came up the idea for what is now known as BookCrossing in March 2001. By April 2003 the website had over 113,000 members, and in 2004 the ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'' included the word "bookcrossing".

In July 2007 Singapore became the first official BookCrossing country in the world. 2,000 locations within the country were designated as 'hotspots', similar to Official BookCrossing Zones.
