'''Romanization''' or '''Latinization''' of Ukrainian is how to write the Ukrainian language in Latin letters. Latin letters are the type that are currently used for this article.

This makes the language easier for non-Ukrainian people to read and pronounce.

There are two different kinds of Romanization. These methods are transliteration, representing written text, and Transcription (linguistics)|transcription, representing the spoken words.

 Transliteration 
Transliteration is the letter-for-letter representation of text using a Latin writing system.

The International scholarly system, also called scientific transliteration, is most often seen in linguistic publications about Slavic languages. Each character represents one meaningful unit of sound. This is based on the Croatian language|Croatian Latin alphabet.

Transcription
Transcription is the representation of the spoken word. Phonetic transcription represents every single sound, or phone, and can be used to compare different dialects of a language. It is more specifed as the Transliteration.

 Transliteration can be rendered in a simplified form:
 Doubled consonants ''ж, х, ц, ч, ш'' are simplified, for example Запоріжжя→''Zaporizhia''.
 Apostrophe and soft sign are omitted, except for ''ьо'' and ''ьї'' which are always rendered as ''’o'' and ''’i''.
b. ''gh'' is used in the romanization of ''зг'' (''zgh''), avoiding confusion with ''ж'' (''zh'').
c. The second variant is used at the beginning of a word.
