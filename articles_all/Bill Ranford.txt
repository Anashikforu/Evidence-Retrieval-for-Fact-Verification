'''William Edward Ranford''' (born December 14, 1966 in Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon, Manitoba) is a Canadians|Canadian retired professional ice hockey goaltender and is the current goaltending coach for the Los Angeles Kings. He graduated from New Westminster Secondary School in 1985. He was selected in the third round of the 1985 NHL Entry Draft, 52nd overall, by the Boston Bruins.  Over the course of fifteen National Hockey League|NHL seasons, Ranford would play with Boston, the Edmonton Oilers, Washington Capitals, Tampa Bay Lightning, and Detroit Red Wings, winning two Stanley Cups, a Canada Cup, and the 1994 Hockey World Championships while playing for Canada.

Early life and career
As a child, Ranford took figure skating lessons, before eventually decided to go into goaltending.  Because his father was in the armed forces, Ranford lived in Germany for a few years, as well as various places in Canada.  He played for local teams in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island and Red Deer, Alberta.

Ranford spent his junior career with the New Westminster Bruins, playing two seasons with the team before being drafted by the Boston Bruins in the 3rd round (52nd overall) in the 1985 NHL Entry Draft..

Ranford's post-draft year, 1985–86 NHL season|1985–86, was an eventful one, as Ranford was named to the WHL Second All-Star Team, and saw his first NHL action after the WHL season ended, winning three of four games for Boston, before going 0–2 in the playoffs.

To start the next year, Boston assigned him to the Moncton Golden Flames of the American Hockey League|AHL, where he went 3–0 to start the season, and wound up spending the rest of the year with Boston.  The replacement of Bruins coach Butch Goring with Terry O'Reilly led to Ranford falling out of favour, and eventually being dealt on March 8, 1988 from the Boston Bruins with Geoff Courtnall to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Andy Moog.

Following the trade, he spent most of the 1987–88 NHL season|next season with the AHL's Maine Mariners, but that would be the last time he would play at the minor-league level.

NHL career

Ranford won his first Stanley Cup in 1988, as the backup to Grant Fuhr.  However, in 1990 despite constant comparisons to the injured Fuhr, Ranford emerged as a first-rate goaltender, leading the Oilers to the Stanley Cup and winning the Conn Smythe Trophy (playoff MVP) in the process. It was the last cup that the Edmonton Oilers dynasty would win.  Ranford went on to play the next six seasons in Edmonton, before being dealt back to the Boston Bruins on January 11, 1996 for Mariusz Czerkawski, Sean Brown, and a 1st Round Pick in the 1996 Entry Draft (Matthieu Descoteaux).

After less than two seasons with Boston, Ranford was dealt to the Washington Capitals on March 1, 1997 with Adam Oates and Rick Tocchet for Jason Allison, Anson Carter, Jim Carey (ice hockey)|Jim Carey, a conditional draft pick in the 1998 Entry Draft, and a 3rd Round Pick in the 1997 Entry Draft (Lee Goren).  In 1998 the Washington Capitals advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, it was Ranfords third trip to the finals.  On June 18, 1998, he was dealt to the Tampa Bay Lightning for a 2nd Round Pick in the 1999 Entry Draft and a 3rd Round Pick in the 1998 Entry Draft (Todd Hornung).

He began the season with the Tampa Bay Lightning, but was traded to the Detroit Red Wings on March 23, 1999 for a conditional draft pick.  It was the second deal between the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Detroit Red Wings that day.  The prior trade brought Wendel Clark and a draft pick to the Detroit Red Wings and Goaltender Kevin Hodson and a draft pick to the Tampa Bay Lightning.  The Wendel Clark trade made the Bill Ranford deal happen.

His final year in the NHL was 2000, where Ranford returned to Edmonton as a free-agent backing up Tommy Salo before announcing his retirement on April 24.
