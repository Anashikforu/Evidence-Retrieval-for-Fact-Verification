The '''continental crust''' is the layer of granite|granitic, sedimentary rock|sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks which form the continents and the areas of shallow seabed close to their shores, known as Continental shelf|continental shelves.

It consists mostly of feldspar and other sialic rocks. It is less dense than the material of the Earth's Mantle (geology)|mantle, which consists of mafic rock. Continental crust is also less dense than oceanic crust, though it is considerably thicker; mostly 35 to 40&nbsp;km versus the average oceanic thickness of around 7â€“10&nbsp;km. About 40% of the Earth's surface lies on-top of continental crust.

The continental crust is separated from the oceanic crust by the continental margin.
