In Major League Baseball, the '''National League Championship Series''' ('''NLCS'''), played in October, is a playoff round that decides the winner of the National League pennant. The winner of the series moves on to play the winner of the American League Championship Series in baseball's championship, the World Series.

History

In 1969, the LCS began play as the leagues were expanded to two divisions.  Initially, it was a best-of-five series.  In 1985, it became best-of-seven.  Since 1995, the two winners from the National League Division Series advance to the NLCS.
