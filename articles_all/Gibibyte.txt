A '''gibibyte''' (GiB) is a unit of measurement in computers and similar electronic devices. One gibibyte holds 1024 mebibytes (MiB). Some people call this number of bytes a gigabyte. This would be considered the binary equivalent to the base-10 gigabyte, which consists of exactly one billion bytes.

A gibibyte is equivalent to 2³⁰ bytes (1,073,741,824 bytes) while a gigabyte is 10⁹ bytes (1,000,000,000 or a billion bytes)

1024 gibibytes make one tebibyte.
