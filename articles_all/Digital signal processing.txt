'''Digital signal processing''' ('''DSP''') is concerned with the processing of digital signals or analog signals after converting from Analog-to-digital converter|analog to digital format.
DSP includes subfields like: communication signals processing, radar signal processing, sensor array processing, digital image processing, etc.

DSP is usually used with Analog signal|real-world analog signals found in our lives, the first step is usually to convert the signal from an analog to a digital form, by using an analog-to-digital converter. Often, the required output signal is another Analog signal|real-world analog signal, which requires a digital-to-analog converter.

Digital signal processing algorithms can run on:
# General purpose microprocessors and standard computers.
# Specialized processors called digital signal processors (DSPs).
# Purpose-built hardware such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
# Digital Signal Controllers (mostly for industrial applications such as motor control).
# Stream processing that works very well for traditional DSP or Graphics processing unit|graphics processing applications (such as image, video).
