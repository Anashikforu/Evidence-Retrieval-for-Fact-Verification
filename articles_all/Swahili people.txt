 Religion 
Islam came to the East African coast around 1012 AD, when the traders from the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula continued to journey to these parts during monsoon seasons and to have contact with the local people through trade, marriage, and an exchange of ideas. Because of this interaction, most of the Swahili today are Muslim. The Swahili follow a very strict and orthodox form of Islam.

 Economy

Trade contacts have been noted as early as 100 A.D. by early Roman empire|Roman writers who visited the East African coast in the first century.
