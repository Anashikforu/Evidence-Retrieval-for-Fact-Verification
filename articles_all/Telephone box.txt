A '''telephone box''' or '''phone booth''' is a public kiosk enclosing a payphone. It is usually an item of street furniture, though some may be inside a building.

United Kingdom telephone boxes were designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and were common in the UK, Malta and Gibraltar. The colour red was chosen to make them easy to spot. Because of the growth of mobile phones, telephone boxes are steadily being removed.
