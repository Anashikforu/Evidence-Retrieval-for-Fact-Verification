A '''Verbandsgemeinde''' (plural '''Verbandsgemeinden''') is an administrative unit unique to the Germany|German States of Germany|Bundeslands (federal states) of Rhineland-Palatinate and, since 2009, Saxony-Anhalt.

Rhineland-Palatinate
There are 163 Verbandsgemeinden in Rhineland-Palatinate, which are grouped into the 24 districts and subdivided into nearly 2200 '''Ortsgemeinden'''.  
Most of these Verbandsgemeinden were established in 1969. Formerly the name of the administrative units was ''Amt''.  Most of the functions of municipal government for several villages are consolidated and administered centrally from a larger or more central village among the group, while the individual villages (Ortsgemeinden) still maintain a limited degree of local autonomy.
