'''''Ender's Game''''' (1985) is one of the most famous books written by Orson Scott Card. It takes place in Earth's future where mankind has barely survived two attacks by the "buggers", a species of alien, and the International Fleet is getting ready for war. In order to find and train a leader for the next invasion, the world's smartest children, including Ender Wiggin, are taken into a place called Battle School at a very young age. The book takes place around the year 2135, and its sequels ''Speaker for the Dead'', ''Xenocide'', ''Children of the Mind'', ''A War of Gifts: An Ender Story|A War of Gifts'', and ''Ender in Exile: Ganges'' follow Ender to different planets as he travels far into the future.

A new version was released in 1991 to keep facts accurate (such as the end of the Soviet Union).
