'''Relative density''' is the ratio of the density|densities of two materials.   The term '''specific gravity''' is similar but not the same.  In specific gravity, the reference material is water. Mathematically, relative density is found with:
:
G = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{object}}{\rho_\mathrm{reference}}\,
