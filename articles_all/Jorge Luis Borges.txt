Part of this quote is also attributed to a heresiarch of Uqbar in "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius".)

 "The central fact of my life has been the existence of words and the possibility of weaving those words into poetry."

 "I do not write for a select minority, which means nothing to me, nor for that adulated platonic entity known as 'The Masses'. Both abstractions, so dear to the demagogue, I disbelieve in. I write for myself and for my friends, and I write to ease the passing of time." — ''Introduction to The Book of Sand''

 "I have always imagined that paradise will be a kind of library."
