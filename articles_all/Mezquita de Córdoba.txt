The '''Mezquita''' (Spanish for "mosque") of Cordoba is a Roman Catholic cathedral. It used to be a mosque  in the Andalusian city of CÃ³rdoba, Spain. After the Spanish Reconquista, it was changed back into a church, and some of the Islamic columns and arcs were replaced by a basilica in early Baroque style. Today it houses the main church of the diocese of Cordoba in Spain.
