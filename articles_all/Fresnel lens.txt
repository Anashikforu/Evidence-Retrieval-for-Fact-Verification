A '''Fresnel lens''' is an Lens (optics)|optical lens, which was originally developed for Lighthouses. It is named after its inventor, France|French physics|physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel. The name is pronounced  /freɪˈnɛl/ (fray-NELL), the 's' is silent. Before Fresnel,  Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon and marquis de Condorcet|Condorcet proposed a similar design, as a way to make large burning lenses.  

The design allows the construction of lenses of large aperture and short focal length without the weight and volume of material that would be required in conventional lens (optics)|lens design.  Compared to earlier lenses, the Fresnel lens is much thinner. More light can pass through. Lighthouses that use these kind of lenses can be seen from farther away.
