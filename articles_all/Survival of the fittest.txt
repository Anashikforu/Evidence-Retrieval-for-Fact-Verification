'''''Survival of the fittest''''' is a famous phrase of Herbert Spencer which describes the idea that, in nature, there is competition to survive and reproduce. It is a metaphor, as are the phrases ''struggle for existence'', and ''natural selection'', both of which were used by Charles Darwin."I should premise that I use this term struggle for existence in a large and metaphorical sense"; "This preservation of favourable individual differences and variations, and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have called Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest." –  It was his way of making an analogy with artificial selection (selective breeding), a practice which was well understood in England at that time.

Spencer's ''Principles of Biology'' was the first to use the phrase ''survival of the fittest'' in print. Darwin agreed that the phrase ''survival of the fittest'' was better than ''natural selection''. Natural selection personified nature, but was really about survival. ''Survival of the fittest'' would avoid this problem, but it "lost the analogy between nature's selection and the fanciers" (breeders). The phrase was first used by Darwin in the 5th edition of ''The Origin'' published in 1869,{{Citation

In the introduction to the 5th edition Darwin gave full credit to Spencer, writing "I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient".{{Citation

= So did Wallace =
The co-discoverer of natural selection, Alfred Russel Wallace, also used the terms ''survival of the fittest'' and ''struggle for existence''. He rather preferred the last two terms to natural selection.Wallace A.R. 1889. ''Darwinism''. Macmillan, London. see xi, and Chapter 2. Since both these evolutionists used them, the three metaphors were obviously useful in getting over what were, at the time, unfamiliar ideas.

Current use of the phrase
The phrase ''survival of the fittest'' is shorthand for the fact that not all members of a species will contribute equally to the next generation. It is not a value judgement, but a concept of evolution equivalent to natural selection. Fitness is now used in a highly technical sense in population genetics, which should not be confused with its use in everyday language."Stephen Jay Gould, 
Today, the phrase ''survival of the fittest'' is widely used in popular literature for many topics, not just those related to biology. It has widely been used both by people who are in favour of Social Darwinism and those who are against it. It has also been used to talk about competition of all kinds. Popular literature often uses the phrase as a catchphrase. All such extensions of a metaphor need to be watched carefully. They may preserve the original meaning, or they may not.
