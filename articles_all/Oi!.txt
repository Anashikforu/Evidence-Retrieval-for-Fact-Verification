'''Oi!''' is a type of punk rock that was started in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s.Dalton, Stephen, "Revolution Rock", ''Vox'', June 1993 The people that started it wanted to connect punk with a working class street-level following. Oi! is a mixing of the Musical genre|styles of early punk bands, such as The Clash, Sex Pistols and the Ramones. It is also influenced by early British rock and roll|rock bands (such as The Rolling Stones and The Who), football (soccer)|football chants, Pub rock (UK)|pub rock and glam rock bands. The music is often very simple, and the lyrics are wikt:blunt|blunt (brutally honest, without wikt:tact|tact).Glasper, Ian (2004). ''Burning Britain'' (London: Cherry Red), p. 282.

Punk rock began to become popular in the 1970s. Some perceived that it was becoming more and more commercialised. This was the kind of thing that punks were against. Oi! began partly as a response to this perception. It was also partly a response to stereotype|stereotyping that others made about punks. One stereotype was that many people in the early punk rock scene were young people using big words and trying to be artistic, but failing.John Robb (musician)|Robb, John (2006). ''Punk Rock: An Oral History'' (London: Elbury Press). .

Early Oi! bands such as Sham 69 were around for years before the word ''Oi!'' was used to describe their style of music. The word was first used as a name for the new genre in 1980, by journalist Garry Bushell. He took the name from the way the Cockney Rejects used "Oi (interjection)|Oi!" during live shows to introduce their songs.
