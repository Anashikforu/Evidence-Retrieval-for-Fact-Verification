'''Deduction''' is one of the two main types of reasoning. The other is Inductive reasoning|induction. In deduction, we apply a general rule to a particular case.

Deductive arguments are attempts to show that a conclusion must follow from a set of premises or Hypothesis|hypotheses. A deductive argument is Validity|valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.

Aristotle, the first person we know who wrote down laws of deduction, gives this example of deduction:

 All men are mortal.
 Socrates is a man.
 Therefore, Socrates is a mortal.

The first two statements are called "premises". The last statement is called the "conclusion". The conclusion is taken from the premises. 
#If the conclusion is wrong, then at least one of the premises is wrong
#If one of the premises is wrong, the conclusion may also be wrong.

Deductive reasoning is often called "top-down logic", whereas inductive reasoning is called "bottom-up reasoning".
