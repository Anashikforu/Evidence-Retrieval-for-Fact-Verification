'''Shurat Islam''', formerly known as '''Kharijites''', was a branch of Islam. It was one of the three main branches of Islam, along with Shia Islam and Sunni Islam. Though, the branch has no followers today, the Ibadi movement is seen as a moderate current demonization of Shurat Islam. However, Ibadis reject themselves being Shuratis.

Initially, Muslims were divided into two groups, Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims. After caliph Uthman's death, Ali and Muawiya I were having a war. At this time, the Shurati Muslims emerged, who did not pledge allegiance to Ali or Muawiya I. Rather than allegiance, Shurati Muslims decided to attack Ali and Muawiya I's followers.

Sometimes, the term ''Kharijite'' (or ''Neo-Kharijite'') is also used for some Islamic terrorist groups. Examples of such groups are the Groupe islamique arm√© in Algeria, or the Takfir wal-Hijra in Egypt.
