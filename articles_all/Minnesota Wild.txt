The '''Minnesota Wild''' are a NHL team based in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The team's name was chosen by a fans' contest. The logo suggests the "wild" lands of northern Minnesota. It includes trees, the moon, stars and a river. Those things are surrounded by the outline of the head of a wild animal, possibly a bear.

The Wild joined the NHL in 2000. They play at the Xcel Energy Center in downtown St. Paul.
