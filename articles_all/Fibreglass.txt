'''Fibreglass''' (US: fiberglass) is a composite material. It is a fiber-reinforced polymer|fibre-reinforced polymer made of a plastic reinforced by fine fibres made of glass. The composite material may be called '''glass-reinforced plastic''' ('''GRP''').

Fibreglass is cheaper and more flexibility|flexible than carbon fibre. It is stronger than many metals (when compared by weight), and can be moulding|moulded into complex shapes. The plastic matrix is usually a thermoset polymer â€“ such as epoxy or polyester resin,  or it may be a thermoplastic.Mayer, Rayner M. 1993. ''Design with reinforced plastics''. Springer. 

The benefits of fibreglass include:

 Fibreglass is strong with a long durability, and can withstand weathering
 Designs that cannot be achieved with glass can be done so with fibreglass
 Cost effective
 Fibreglass is non-conductive, as well as being radio frequency transparent, and has a lower reaction to thermal-conductivity
 Has the appearance of glass while offering more diverse usages

 Uses 
 Sail planes, Sports cars, micro cars, Kart racing|karts, lorries, wind turbine blades.
 Pods, domes and architectural features where a light weight is needed
 Roofing products, swimming pools and composite housing
 Protective sleeving for RF Antennas
 Electrical enclosures
 Piping for above and below ground systems

 Use of the term 
"Fiberglass" refers to the ''complete glass fiber reinforced composite material'', rather than just the glass fibre inside it.
