The United Kingdom has different sorts of counties.  Some are traditional areas and some are for local government or other government things.

Counties (Traditional)

These counties are sometimes called ''historic counties'', ''traditional counties'' or ''ancient or geographical counties''.Census Report, 1891 (General Register Office)  People argue about how much they exist in law.  They are useful for genealogical and historic matters.  Anyone may choose to use traditional counties or not.

The traditional counties have had nothing to do with government since 1889.  However until 1974 most local government counties were very like them.

The United Kingdom has 92 traditional counties.

Local government administrative areas have different functions and powers in each of the different countries in the United Kingdom (England and the devolved administrations of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) This resulted from devolution of administrative, executive, or legislative authority to the new institutions operating. The areas administered by local government have different types of names in the different parts of the United Kingdom.

 '''Districts of England'''

There is a total of 326 English districts. As the structure of local government in England is not uniform, there are currently four principal types of district-level subdivision (numbers shown in brackets)

# Unitary authority (55)
# London boroughs (32)
