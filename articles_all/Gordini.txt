'''Gordini''' is a French sports car manufacturer. The firm was founded by Amédée Gordini. His nickname was "Le Sorcier", which means "The Sorcerer".

Gordini competed in Formula One from 1950 to 1956.

Gordini worked with Renault as an engine tuner. He sold his firm to Renault. Renault entered '''Renault-Gordini''' cars at the 24 Hours of Le Mans from 1962 until 1969.
