The '''pygmy possums''' are species of small possums that together form the marsupial family '''Burramyidae'''. They weigh 6 to 8 grams.

There are five living species of pygmy possum, in two genera. Four of the species are endemic to Australia, with one species also occurring in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.

After the 2020 fires, pygmy possums survived on Kangaroo Island, Australia.BBC News
