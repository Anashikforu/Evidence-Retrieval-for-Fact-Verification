The '''Battle of Gettysburg''' (locally . was fought July 1–3, 1863. The battle took place in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It was the battle with the largest number of wikt:casualty|casualties in the American Civil War. Heth did this without Reconnaissance|scouting ahead to see what was at Gettysburg. The job of scouting belonged to the Confederate cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart. But they had been gone for over a week. So, blind to what was ahead of them, his soldiers ran directly into a Union cavalry division commanded by General John Buford. This started the fighting even though Heth and other commanders were under orders from Lee not to start a battle. But, as each side brought in more troops, it became a full-scale battle. Lee started moving much of his army there. One of his goals was to fight the Union army and wikt:destroy|destroy it. Now, he would have to do it at Gettysburg.

About 5.30&nbsp;a.m. on the morning of July 1, the battle started. Heth probed ahead wikt:cautious|cautiously to a point about two miles west of Gettysburg. Buford's cavalry was deliberately slowing his progress. At about 10&nbsp;a.m. the Union I Corps arrived commanded by General John F. Reynolds. They set themselves up along McPherson's Ridge to oppose Heth's Confederates. During the fighting Reynolds was killed but the Confederates were driven back. Meanwhile, both sides brought up wikt:reinforcement|reinforcements. The Union set up defense (military)|defenses of the town with I Corps defending the western approaches with XI Corps to the north. The Flanking maneuver|flanks were covered by Buford's cavalry. One Union division was held in wikt:reserve|reserve on Cemetery Ridge. In the afternoon, when Lee arrived, the Confederates still did not know the strength of the Union forces they were facing. They also had not scouted the terrain. One division of Ewell's Corps had attacked the Union I Corps just after noon. At about 2&nbsp;p.m. Heth's division joined Ewell's troops in the attack on I Corps. At about 3&nbsp;p.m., another of Ewell's Confederate divisions, commanded by General Jubal Early, attacked the flank of the Union XI Corps. By 4&nbsp;p.m., both of the Union corps retreated through Gettysburg and took up positions on Cemetery Ridge. So far, the Union had lost about 9,000 men including about 3,000 who had been wikt:capture|captured. The Confederates had lost about 6,500 men by this point. So the first day of battle was wikt:technically|technically a Confederate victory numbers-wise. But Union Army|Federal troops held the high ground as more reinforcements were still arriving. Based on the first day's fighting, Lee was convinced he could defeat Meade at Gettysburg.

Late in the day, Lee sent the famous order to Confederate General Richard S. Ewell to take cemetery ridge "if wikt:practicable|practicable.”{{efn|Lee was used to giving wikt:discretion|discretionary, sometimes wikt:vague|vague, orders leaving the final decision up to his commanders. He had done this routinely with General Stonewall Jackson, usually with great success. While he had been awaiting orders from Lee, Ewell had ridden out to take a closer look at Cemetery Ridge. Based on what he saw and the confusing order, he decided it was not practicable to take the hill and set up camp. Instead, he decided to leave the assault for the next day. This was the first major mistake of the battle for the South. The Army of the Potomac would end the day with around 21,900 men strongly positioned on Culp's Hill and Cemetery Ridge. The Army of Northern Virginia would have around 27,000 men from Benner's Hill to Seminary Ridge.

 July 2 

On the second day of battle, most of both armies had arrived. The Union line held the high ground in a defensive wikt:formation|formation that looked like a fishhook. On July 2, Lee ordered General James Longstreet, commander of the Confederate I Corps, to attack the Union left flank as early in the day as possible. Longstreet had the furthest to go and midway in their march realized the Union lines could see them. They went back and had to take a different wikt:route|route. Longstreet could not get his corps into position until about 4&nbsp;p.m. when he began his attack. His attack on the Union line lasted for over three hours but could not break the Union line. Hill's Corps failed to be effective in the center. Ewell did not attack Cemetery Ridge as instructed in Lee's confusing order, but made some progress in taking Culp's Hill.

Union Major General Daniel Sickles, a political general commanding III Corps, disobeyed Meade's orders and moved his troops forward to the Peach Orchard. Within an hour, his entire III Corps was nearly wiped out by Longstreet. Sickles was badly wounded by a cannonball and lost a leg. Being wounded was all that saved him from a court-martial. Sickles' blunder nearly lost the entire battle for the Union.''Encyclopedia of the Veteran in America'', ed. William A. Pencak (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2009), p. 324

On the night of July 2, Longstreet's largest division commanded by General George Pickett arrived and was placed in the center of the Confederate line. Lee's plan for the next day was to attack on both the Union right and left, just as he had done the day before. Lee was still certain he could break the Union line and win the battle. That day Stuart's cavalry had caught up with Lee's army and Lee ordered Stuart to ride around the East side of Gettysburg and attack the Union rear. Ewell had also been reinforced and was ordered to take Culp's Hill the next morning.

Meade ordered the Union XII Corps to drive Ewell's forces off the captured trenches on Culp's Hill. They were to move at daylight the next morning. He was determined the remainder of the Union Army would hold its position and wait for Lee to attack.

 July 3 
Ewell began fighting on Culp's Hill at Twilight|first light. Lee rode to Longstreet's headquarters only to find Longstreet had wikt:misunderstood|misunderstood his orders. He was planning a turning movement against the Union left. Now, with no hope of a coordinated attack, Lee changed the plan. Longstreet was to attack the Union center on Cemetery Ridge. Ewell's forces failed in their counterattacks and were forced to withdraw from Culp's Hill by about 11:00&nbsp;a.m. Lee pinned all his hopes on Longstreet's attack on the center. Longstreet had the last fresh division in Lee's army. It was made up of three brigades, commanded by generals James L. Kemper, Richard B. Garnett, and Lewis A. Armistead, led by Pickett.

= Cannons =
First, a bombardment by about 140 Confederate cannons on the Union lines was ordered. The bombardment started about 1&nbsp;p.m. The cannons duel lasted for between one and two hours, depending on the source (most say about an hour). The Confederate artillery chief, General Edward Porter Alexander, had only intended it to last for about 25&nbsp;minutes. But he then realized it had done little damage to the Union line so he continued. But he also had to worry about running out of ammunition and not have enough to support the charge that was Pickett was about to make. When the Union guns fell silent, Porter thought he had knocked them out. But it was a trick by the Union artillery chief. His guns were waiting for the charge the Union forces knew was coming. Alexander sent word to Pickett he could start his attack.

The wikt:cannonade|cannonade could be heard as far away as Philadelphia. It was probably the loudest noise that had ever been wikt:heard|heard on the North America|North American continent up to that time. In the end the Confederate cannons may have killed as many as 200 Union soldiers in the area that would later become known as the "bloody angle". But the Union guns may have killed more Confederate troops.

= Pickett's Charge =


Calling the Confederate attack on the Union center "Pickett's Charge" is misleading for two reasons. First, Pickett commanded only one of the three units in the assault. Second, it was not a charge (warfare)|charge, which is a rapid advance towards the enemy, it was an attack which moved forward more slowly and over a longer distance. These Virginia units were joined by several smaller units of Confederates (some from North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama) whose numbers had been reduced by the fighting over the first two days. When the cannons stopped, Pickett went to Longstreet to ask permission to begin the attack. Longstreet, sure the attack would fail, silently wikt:nod|nodded his head and gave a wave of his hand. Longstreet had tried to get Lee to call off the attack, but Lee would not listen.

Over 12,000 Confederates stepped out from the trees and Military organization|formed up for the long march forward. Waiting for them behind a low stone fence on Cemetery Ridge were about 5,000 Union troops, most of whom belonged to General Winfield Scott Hancock's II Corps. Depending on the source, this was between 2:00 and 3:00&nbsp;p.m. As they marched forward across the  distance, Union artillery killed large numbers of troops. He then told Pickett to rally his division. Pickett famously replied, "General, I have no division."

At about the same time as the main attack, Stuart's cavalry attacked the Union rear but the attack also failed.

 Aftermath 
Lee brought an army into Pennsylvania that numbered 75,054 men and lost 22,638 casualties or about 30% of his army.

Meade was severely criticized for not counterattacking Lee after the third day of battle. The next day Meade sent out skirmishers, but did not attack. Lee had his army hold its position on Seminary Ridge all day on July 4. The more than 10,000 wounded men would be moved by wagon train  to Williamsport and cross the Potomac to Virginia. The rest of Lee's army followed on the night of July 4–5, screened by Jeb Stuart's cavalry.
