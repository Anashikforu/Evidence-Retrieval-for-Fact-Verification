'''Phoenicia''' was a civilization to the north of Canaan. They wrote with an alphabet from which the alphabets of Europe evolved.

Phoenicians set up colonies in the Mediterranean region and beyond. Carthage was one of them. Phoenician traders went as far as the British Isles to buy tin. At their peak, the Phoenicians were a major power in the Mediterranean.
