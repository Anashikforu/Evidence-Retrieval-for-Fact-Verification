'''Tagalog''' is one of the main languages spoken in the Philippines and is the national language of the country. More than 22 million people speak it as their first language.

It was originally spoken by the Tagalog people in the Philippines, who were mainly in Bulacan, Cavite, and some parts of Luzon. Now, Tagalog is spoken nationwide and used by Filipinos from different parts of the country to understand each other.

It originally was used with an abugida, the Baybayin|Baybayin script, but the Latin alphabet is now used.
