'''Big Max''' is a type of Squash (plant)|squash that can grow to be more than 100 pounds. They can also be  in diameter if they are grown properly. The flesh is good for being canned and frozen.

However, because they are so big, cooking with these squash is hard. Individual fruits are round to slightly flattened.

 Growing 
These squash are best planted between two and four weeks after the average last frost, and they  become ripe 110 to 120 days after being planted. The plants need lots of room to grow well, and to get them very big, only one fruit should be grown on one vine. They are harvested before the first light frost, when the plant's leaves die.
