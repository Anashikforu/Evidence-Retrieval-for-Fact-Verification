The eighth cell projects into the volume of space exterior to the boundary.

In geometry, a '''polychoron''' (plural: '''polychora''') is a figure in four dimensions. The word comes from Greek language|Greek ''poly'', which means ''many'' and ''choros'' which means ''room'', or ''space''. Sometimes the figure is called '''4-polytope''' or '''polyhedroid'''. The analogue figure in two dimensions is a polygon, and the one in three dimensions is a polyhedron.
