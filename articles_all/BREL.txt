'''BREL''' stands for '''British Rail Engineering Limited''', which was the engineering division for British Rail until the design and building trains in the United Kingdom went private. 

They made trains like the British Rail Class 210 diesel multiple unit and the experimental  '''Advanced Passenger Train''' ('''APT''')  tilting High Speed Train during the 1970s and early 1980s.
