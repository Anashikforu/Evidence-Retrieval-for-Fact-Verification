The '''Durand Line''' is the international  land border between Afghanistan and Pakistan in South Asia|South-Central Asia. It was established after an 1897 memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Mortimer Durand of British Raj|British India and Afghan Amir Abdur Rahman Khan.  Referred to as a frontier line, it is named after Mortimer Durand, who was the Foreign Secretary of colonial British India at the time. Later, Abdur Rahman Khan's successor, Amir Habibullah Khan signed a new agreement with Britain which again confirmed the legality of the Durand Line. King Amanullah Khan also accepted Durand line as international border between Afghanistan and British India after signing the Treaty of Rawalpindi|Anglo-Afghan treaty of 1919.

The Durand Line cuts through the Afghan tribal areas, politically dividing ethnic Pashtun people|Pashtuns and Baloch people who live on both sides.

Afghan Pashtun leaders claim Pakistani territories and say that the Durand Line is "an issue of historical importance for Afghanistan. The Afghan people, not the government, can take a final decision on it." However, non-Pashtuns Afghans have always recognized durand line as international border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
