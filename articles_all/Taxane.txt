'''Taxanes''' are poisonous alkaloids produced by Yew plants.

Alkaloids are natural base (chemistry)|basic chemical compounds which contain nitrogen atoms.IUPAC. Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book"). Compiled by A.D. McNaught and A. Wilkinson. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford 1997. XML on-line corrected version: 
Alkaloids are made by a large variety of organisms, but taxanes are produced only by plants of the genus ''Taxus''.

Taxanes work mainly by disrupting the function of cell microtubules. Microtubules are essential to cell division, so taxanes are essentially mitosis|mitotic inhibition|inhibitors. This explains why taxanes have been used to produce chemotherapy drugs.Takimoto CH, Calvo E.
