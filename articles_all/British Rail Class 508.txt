The British Rail '''Class 508''' electric multiple units ("EMUs") were built by BREL at York works in 1979-80. They were the fourth variety of BR's then-standard 1972 design for suburban EMUs, eventually encompassing 755 vehicles and five classes (British Rail Class 313|313/British Rail Class 314|314/British Rail Class 315|315/British Rail Class 507|507/508). They have mostly worked on the Merseyrail network since 1983, and continue to do so, now refurbished by Alstom's Eastleigh railway works|Eastleigh Works.
