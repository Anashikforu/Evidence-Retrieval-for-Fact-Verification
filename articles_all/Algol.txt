The large and bright primary Algol A is regularly eclipsed by the dimmer Algol B every 2.87 days. The pair is separated by only 0.062 astronomical units (AU) from each other, so close that Algol A is slowly stripping off Algol B's outer layers.

It is one of the best known double stars that can only be seen in spectroscopes, the first star of its type discovered, and one of the first variable stars  to be discovered before it explodes.
