A '''sampler''' is an electronic musical instrument that is similar to the synthesizer. What a sample does is that instead of creating sounds from scratch however, a sampler starts with more than one recording (or "Sampling (music)|samples") of different sounds added by the user, and then plays each back based on how the instrument is configured.  Because these samples are usually stored in RAM, the information can be quickly accessed.
