'''Charles Dickens''' (7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was one of the great English people|English writers of the 19th century.

 Early life 
Charles Dickens was born in Portsmouth, England. His parents were John Dickens (1785-1851),
When Dickens was born, he had dyslexia and so he could not read or write properly, unlike other kids. When Charles was 12 years old, his family moved to Camden, London. He worked in a blacking factory there while his father was in prison for debt. Dickens's hard times in the factory served as a foundation of ideas for many of his novels. Many of them, like ''Oliver Twist'', later became famous. When his great-grandmother died and transmitted money, Charles' father paid off his debts and was released from prison. Charles did not like working and wished to stop after his father had been released. However, his mother said that the family needed the money and so Charles was forced to continue working. Charles then finished his schooling and got a job as an office boy for an attorney. After finding that job dull, he taught himself shorthand and became a journalist that reported on the government. Dickens was a Unitarian.

He was once involved in a train crash near Stapleford, Kent.

 Writer
