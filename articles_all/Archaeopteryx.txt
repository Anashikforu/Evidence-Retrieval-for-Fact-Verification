'''''Archaeopteryx''''' is one of the most important fossils ever discovered. It is a bird from the Jurassic|Upper Jurassic, about 150 million years ago. It shows the evolutionary link between non-avian theropod dinosaurs and birds, but it is not the ancestor of modern birds.Benton M.J. 2015. ''Vertebrate palaeontology''. Wiley Blackwell IBSN 978-1-118-40684-7, p274. 

The first ''Archaeopteryx'' was found in 1860 near Solnhofen in Bavaria, Germany. Today, ten skeletons and one feather of ''Archaeopteryx'' have been found.Mayr, Gerald ''et al'' 2007. The tenth skeletal specimen of Archaeopteryx. ''Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society''. '''149''' (1), 97–116. 
''Archaeopteryx'' looked like a small carnivorous dinosaur with wings and feathers. It had a mouth with teeth, claws on the hands and a long tail. Today, it is known that dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurs, and possibly most theropods, looked like birds and that many had feathers. When they are born, today's South American hoatzin have claws on their wings when they are young, just like ''Archaeopteryx''.

 Analysis 
Thomas Henry Huxley ("Darwin's bulldog"), who was a comparative anatomy|comparative anatomist, made a study of this nearly 150 years ago. He compared ''Archaeopteryx'' with a small theropod dinosaur, ''Compsognathus''. Both of the fossils came from the same place: Solnhofen limestone|Solnhofen in Bavaria, Germany. The strata come from the end of the Jurassic period, about 144 million years ago. He showed that both were very similar except for the front limbs and feathers of ''Archaeopteryx''.

Huxley's study showed the basic relationship between birds and reptiles. He united them under the title of ''Sauropsida''. His papers on ''Archaeopteryx'' and the origin of birds have been of great interest ever since. Huxley concluded that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs.Paul G. 2002. ''Dinosaurs of the Air, the evolution and loss of flight in dinosaurs and birds''. p171–224  Johns Hopkins, Baltimore. 

 Status today 
Only one dinobird has been found from a time before ''Archaeopteryx''. It is called ''Anchiornis huxlei'', from 160 to 155 million years ago. It had feathers on both front and rear legs, and could certainly Gliding|glide. It may or may not have had some ability to fly. This discovery means we cannot say ''Archaeopteryx'' is the first known bird, but its contribution to science has been huge. We now know for sure that a whole group of small theropod dinosaurs had feathers, and that flight was a later, secondary, use of feathers. The first use of feathers was Warm-blooded|temperature regulation, and probably also signal (biology)|signalling (see ''Epidexipteryx'').

= Directly ancestral or not? =
It may be that ''Archaeopteryx'' is not directly ancestral to all birds, but it is still a fine transitional fossil.
:"''Archaeopteryx'', for example, is not necessarily directly ancestral to birds. It may have been a species on a side-branch. However, that in no way disqualifies it as a transitional form, or as evidence for evolution. Evolution predicts that such fossils will exist, and if there was no link between reptiles and birds then Archaeopteryx would not exist, whether it is directly ancestral or not".
