'''Cinco de Mayo ''' (Spanish language|Spanish for "fifth of May") is a holiday celebrating Mexico|Mexican heritage inkling
and pride, and is held on '''May 5'''. It is celebrated in the United States and in some parts of Mexico, mostly in the state of Puebla (state)|Puebla.
In the Mexican state of Puebla, Cinco de Mayo  is celebrated because the Mexican army won the Battle of Puebla from the French army on May 5, 1862. This was a surprising victory. The army was under the leadership of  General Ignacio Zaragoza|Ignacio Zaragoza Segu√≠n.

In the United States Cinco de Mayo is more important than in Mexico."In historical terms, the battle that communities across America are preparing to celebrate this weekend isn't that significant, says John Renteria, director of Centro Civico Mexicano. The May 5, 1862, Battle of Puebla is barely even noticed in Mexico, Renteria said. But the celebration of the defeat of French invaders by an outnumbered Mexican army, led by a Texas-born general, is becoming distinctly American. "It's become more of a cultural, commercial phenomenon in terms of building awareness and educating the public about the Mexican culture," Renteria said. "It's really a U.S. day, not a Mexico thing, and that's fine with us."
