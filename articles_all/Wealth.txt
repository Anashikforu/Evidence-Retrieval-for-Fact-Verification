'''Wealth''' often means that much money is available. But there are several other aspects that can be more important. If one thinks of single persons one will look at their personal property or assets like land and livestock. Looking at countries one thinks of GDP per capita and of natural capital. 

The original meaning of the old English word for "weal", where wealth comes from, was "well-being" or :wikt:welfare|welfare. (It was an adjective.)
