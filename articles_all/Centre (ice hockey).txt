'''Centre''' ('''center''' in the United States) is a position in ice hockey. A centre plays in the middle of the ice as one of three forwards. The centre is between the winger (ice hockey)|left wing and the winger (ice hockey)|right wing, and is the one who takes faceoffs. Because they are in the middle, the centre sometimes has to help the two Defenceman|defencemen when they need help.
