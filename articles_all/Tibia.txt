The '''tibia''', also known as the '''shinbone''', or '''shankbone''', is the larger and stronger of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates. It connects the knee with the ankle bones and is parallel to the fibula. Additionally it is the second largest bone in the body as its supports a significantly large portion of the human bodyweight. The tibia is essential to everyday movement such as standing and walking as well as jumping and running.
