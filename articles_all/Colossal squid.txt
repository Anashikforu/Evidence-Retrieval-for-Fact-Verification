The '''colossal squid''', ''Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni'', is the biggest squid in the world, 9–10 metres (30–33 Foot (unit of length)|feet) long.Roper, C.F.E. & P. Jereb (2010). Family Cranchiidae. In: P. Jereb & C.F.E. Roper (eds.) ''
The colossal squid is bigger than a giant squid. Its body is reddish brown and it lives up to 2000m below the surface of the Southern Ocean. It is the main food eaten by Sperm Whale|sperm whales. The colossal squid has ammonium chloride in its body, so it tastes bad for humans.

It is believed to feed on prey such as chaetognatha, large fish like the Patagonian toothfish and other squid in the deep ocean using bioluminescence.

The colossal squid is thought to have a slow Metabolism|metabolic rate, requiring only around 30&nbsp;g of prey daily.Rosa R. & B.A. Seibel 2010. Slow pace of life of the Antarctic colossal squid. ''Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom'', published online 20 April 2010. 
The eye is 27&nbsp;cm (10.63&nbsp;in) wide, with a lens 12&nbsp;cm across. This is the largest eye of any known animal. These measurements are of the partly collapsed specimen: when living the eye was probably 30 to 40&nbsp;cm (12 to 16 in) across.
The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa is displaying this specimen in an exhibition which opened in 2008.
