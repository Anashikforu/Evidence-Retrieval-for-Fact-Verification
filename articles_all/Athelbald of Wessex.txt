A. Stargardt, 1984), Tafel 78 She was the daughter of Oslac, Athelwulf's butler.Jennifer Ward, ''Women in England in the Middle Ages'' (London: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006), p. 120 When Athelwulf returned to Wessex with his new Queen, Athelbald objected to his father remaining king. To avoid a civil war Athelwulf agreed to take the sub-kingship of Kent. He let Ethelbald retain his position as king of Wessex. Athelwulf died in 858 as the King of Kent.Mike Ashley, ''The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens'' (New york: Carroll & Graf, 1999), p. 317 Athelbald then took his father's young wife Judith as his own wife, apparently without a major scandal.

Despite his marriage to his step-mother Judith, he had no children. He was succeeded by his brother Athelbert of Wessex.Barbara Yorke, Kings and Kingship in Early Anglo-Saxon England (London: Seaby, 1990. , pp. 148–158 & p. 133, table 15.
