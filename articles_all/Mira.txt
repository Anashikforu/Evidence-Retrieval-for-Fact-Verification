 
'''Mira''' is a binary star system with a white dwarf ('''Mira B''', also known as '''VZ Ceti''') star and a red giant ('''Mira A'''). Scientists think Mira is 200-400 light years away in the constellation Cetus. Mira A is a variable star, changing its size and brightness. Other red giant stars that do the same are called '''Mira variables'''. 


Size
Mira has a diameter 332 times that of our sun.

If Mira did not change size, its diameter would be only 240 times larger than the Sun.
