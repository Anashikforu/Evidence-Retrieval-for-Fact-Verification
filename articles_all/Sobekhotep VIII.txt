'''Sobekhotep VIII''' was a Pharaoh of northern Egypt during the 16th Egyptian dynasty. He was one of the ancient Egyptian kings people have little knowledge about. Historians estimate that Sobekhotep VIII was their sovereign leader for 16 years.

It is most likely that Sobekhotep VIII. was the successor of Djehuti and followed by Neferhotep III.Kim Ryholt, The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, Museum Tusculanum Press, (1997), pp.152-154 & 202
