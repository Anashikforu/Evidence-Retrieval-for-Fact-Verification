Universe
=Hyrule=
'''Hyrule''' is a fictional world in ''The Legend of Zelda'' series. It is inhabited by many races, including Hylians, Gorons, Zoras, and others.
 '''Death Mountain''' is a large volcano that Goron species lives on. Ganon has also had his lair in Death Mountain twice.
 '''Gerudo Desert''' is a desert that Ganondorf was born in. Only once every 100 years is a man born, so almost every Gerudo is a woman.
 '''Hyrule Castle''' is the home of the Royal Family, which includes Princess Zelda. It is often Ganon's target.
 '''Kakariko Village''' is a village that first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past''. It appears in many other games after.
 '''Lake Hylia''' is a lake in many of the games. It is often the way to Zora's Domain, the home of the Zora species.
 '''The Lost Woods''' is a forest in many of the games in the series that is easy to get lost in. The Master Sword rests here in ''The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|A Link to the Past'' and Link's home, Kokiri Forest, is right next to the Lost Woods in ''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time''.
=Great Sea=
Long after the adult version Link from ''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'' disappeared, Ganon returned, and when Link did not come to save the people of Hyrule, they asked the Goddesses to flood Hyrule. Hyrule was flooded, and many people died because of it. Hyrule was lost under the sea, and people lived on islands that are scattered around the Great Sea. The events of ''The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker'' take place many years after.
=Termina=
'''Termina''' is a land only in ''The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask'' that Link finds in the Lost Woods, that he has to save before the Moon crashes into it. It is an alternate land to Hyrule, and has many places and people that look or act like people from ''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time''. The people who live in Termina are sometimes referred to as Terminans, or Terminan Hylians.

=Master Sword=
The '''Master Sword''' is a sword found in ''The Legend of Zelda'' series. Link uses it as a weapon in most games.

Known as the Sword of Evil's Bane, the Sword of Time, the Sword of Resurrection, and the Sword That Seals the Darkness. The Master Sword is to only be held by a person destined to be the Hero chosen by the Goddesses. Link in ''The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword'' is the first holder of the Master Sword. The other Links are then given the right to wield the Master Sword because they carry the spirit of the Hero.

=Triforce=

The '''Triforce''' is a mystic object in ''The Legend of Zelda'' universe created by gods Din, Nayru, and Farore. It has three parts - the first part is the Triforce of Courage, which Link has, the second is the Triforce of Wisdom, which Princess Zelda has, and the third is the Triforce of Power, which Ganon has. When it is completed, the person who unites it can make a wish using the power of the gods.
