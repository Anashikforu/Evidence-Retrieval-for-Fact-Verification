Life
When Amundsen was young, he decided he would use his life to explore the wilderness. He was inspired by the lives of Fridtjof Nansen and John Franklin.

In 1903, Amundsen led the first expedition to make it through the Northwest Passage.

In October 1911, he began his expedition to Antarctica with four other men in attempt to be the first man to reach the South Pole.

In 1926, Amundsen and his men made it to the North Pole. This may make Amundsen and his men the first to reach the North Pole.

He disappeared in June 1928 while taking part in a Search and rescue|rescue mission.
