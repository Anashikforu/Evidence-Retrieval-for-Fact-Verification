The '''skippers''' are a family (biology)|family of butterflies, the '''Hesperiidae'''. They are named after their quick, darting flight. 

Skippers used to be classified in their own superfamily, '''Hesperioidea''', because they have their antenna (biology)|antennae clubs hooked backward like a crochet while the other butterflies have club-like tips to their antennae. Skippers also have generally stockier bodies than regular butterflies, with stronger wing muscles. Brower, Andrew V.Z. & Warren, Andrew (April 7, 2008). 
 Subfamilies 
There are about 3500 species of skippers.Ackery P.R; de Jong R. & Vane-Wright R.I. 1999. "The Butterflies: Hedyloidea, Hesperioidea and Papilionoidae". In: Kristensen N.P. (ed) ''Handbook of Zoology: A Natural History of the Phyla of the Animal Kingdom''. Volume IV Arthropoda: Insecta, Part 35: Lepidoptera, Moths and Butterflies Vol.1: Evolution, Systematics, and Biogeography: 263–300. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, New York.  They are usually classified in the following subfamilies:
 Coeliadinae: awls, awlets and policeman (butterfly) (about 75 species)
 Hesperiinae: grass skippers (over 2000 species)
 Heteropterinae: skipperlings (about 150 species)
 Megathyminae: giant skippers (about 100 species)
 Pyrginae: spread-winged skippers (about 1000 species)
 Pyrrhopyginae: firetips (about 150 species)
 Trapezitinae: Australian skippers (about 60 species)

Many species of skippers look frustratingly alike. For example, some species in the genera ''Erynnis'', ''Hesperia'', and ''Amblyscirtes'' cannot currently be distinguished in the field even by experts. The only reliable method of telling them apart involving dissection and examination of the genitalia.
