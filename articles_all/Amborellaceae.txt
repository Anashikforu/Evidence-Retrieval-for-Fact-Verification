'''Amborellaceae''' is a family of flowering plants native to New Caledonia. The family contains only one species, ''Amborella|Amborella trichopoda''.  Botanists think it is the most basal plant in the angiosperm clade.

The Amborellaceae are distinctive. They are sprawling evergreen shrubs or small trees. Their tissue is different from any other Angiosperm. The xylem of ''Amborella'' contains only tracheids; vessel elements are absent.Carlquist S.J. & Schneider E.L. 2001.
