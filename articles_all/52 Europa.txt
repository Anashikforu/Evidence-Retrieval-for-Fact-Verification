It has a diameter of 289&nbsp;km, and was found on February 4, 1858 by Hermann Mayer Salomon Goldschmidt|H. Goldschmidt. It is named after Europa (mythology)|Europa, one of Zeus's conquests in Greek mythology. Europa is the seventh biggest asteroid by volume and the sixth biggest by mass (after Ceres (asteroid)|Ceres, Vesta (asteroid)|Vesta, Pallas (asteroid)|Pallas, Hygiea (asteroid)|Hygiea, and Interamnia (asteroid)|Interamnia) and contains somewhat less than 2% of the mass of the entire main belt.

It is a very dark carbonaceous C-type asteroid|C-type, and the fourth-biggest of these. It orbits close to the Hygiea family|Hygiea asteroid family, but is not a member. Spectroscopic studies have found evidence of olivines and pyroxenes on the surface.

Lightcurve data for Europa has been very hard to interpret, so much so for a long time its period of rotation was in dispute (5 and a half, or 11 hours?) despite many observations#Zappala83|8. It has now been determined that Europa is a prograde rotator, but the exact direction in which its pole points remains unclear. The most detailed analysis indicates that it points either towards about ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (70°, 55°) or (40°, 255°) with a 10° uncertainty #Michalowski04|2. This gives an axial tilt of about 14° or 54°, respectively.

It has been found that the star CV Aquarii found in 1934, was actually an incorrect misidentification of 52 Europa
