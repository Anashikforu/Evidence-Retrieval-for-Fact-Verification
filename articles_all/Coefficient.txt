In mathematics, a '''coefficient''' is a constant multiplication|multiplicative factor of a certain object. For example, the coefficient in ''9x''''2'' is ''9''. A coefficient can also be a variable such as a, b and c. 

The object can be such things as a variable, a vector, a function (mathematics)|function, etc. In some cases, the objects and the coefficients are indexed similarly, leading to expressions such as:
:a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 + \cdots 
where ''a''''n'' is the coefficient of the variable ''x''''n'' for each ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, â€¦
