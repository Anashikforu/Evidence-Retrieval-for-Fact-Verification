'''Terror birds''', the family (biology)|family '''Phorusrhacidae''', were large carnivorous flightless birds. They were the dominant predators in South America during the Cainozoic, from 62â€“2 million years ago.Blanco R.E. and Jones W W. 2005.

''Titanis walleri'', one of the larger species, is known from Texas and Florida in North America. This makes the phorusrhacids the only known example of large South American predators migrating north during the Great American Interchange. This took place after the volcanic Isthmus of Panama land bridge rose about three million years ago.Baskin J.A. 1995. The giant flightless bird ''Titanis walleri'' (Aves: Phorusrhacidae) from the Pleistocene coastal plain of South Texas. ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'', '''15''': 842-844.

A recently discovered species, ''Kelenken guillermoi'' from Middle Miocene some 15 million years ago, discovered in Patagonia in 2006, had the largest bird skull yet found. The fossil has been described as being a .
