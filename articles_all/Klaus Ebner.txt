 Style of writing 
Ebner's short stories have many different topics, which, as critic Julia Rafael says, include actual and socially relevant problems. She describes the stories included in the anthology ''Lose'' as "somewhat imploding" and says that "phantasms, irony and humor have their place, too".Rafael, J.: ''Critic review'' of the book ''Lose'', in: Literarisches Österreich nr. 1 (2008), page 27. Ebner's metaphors have been described as "going beyond reality without losing ground". The journalist Paul C. Jezek said, Ebner's writing style is characterized by very carefully chosen wording. Each sentence has a melody; his short prose especially sounds lyrical. Jezek compares Ebner's sentences to "Japanese paintings – every word has been chosen with special care".''Seine Zeilen sind wie japanische Malerei: Jedes Wort ist sorgfältig gewählt.'' Club 1 Magazin nr. 54 (1988), page 11. Austrian writer and critic Wolfgang Ratz made a similar observation, underlining "the accurateness of Ebner's speech" and "his love for formal details", while pinpointing the sarcastic undertone of the critical stories.Ratz, W.: ''Critic review'' of the book ''Auf der Kippe'', in: Literarisches Österreich nr. 2 (2008), pages 20-21.
