In formal number theory a '''Gödel numbering''' is a function (mathematics)|function which assigns to each symbol and formula of some formal language a unique natural number called a '''Gödel number (GN)'''. The concept was first used by Kurt Gödel for the proof of his Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness theorem. 

A Gödel numbering can be interpreted as an encoding where a number is assigned to each symbol of a mathematical notation, and a stream of natural numbers can then represent some form or function. A numbering (computability theory)|numbering of the set of computable functions can then be represented by a stream of Gödel numbers (also called effective numbers). Rogers' equivalence theorem states   criteria for which those numberings of the set of computable functions  are Gödel numberings. 

Definition

Given a countable set ''S'', a '''Gödel numbering''' is an injective function
:f:S \to \mathbb{N}
with both ''f'' and f^{-1} (the inverse function|inverse of ''f'') being computable functions.

Examples
=Base notation and strings=
One of the simplest Gödel numbering schemes is used every day: The correspondence between integers and their representations as strings of symbols. For example, the sequence '''2 3''' is understood, by a particular set of rules, to correspond to the number twenty-three. Similarly, strings of symbols from some alphabet of ''N'' symbols can be encoded by identifying each symbol with a number from 0 to ''N'' and reading the string as the base (mathematics)|base ''N''+1 representation of an integer.

=Gödel's encoding=
The numbering system used in Gödel's incompleteness theorem encodes arbitrary sequences of any positive integers, which allowed Gödel to encode not just strings of symbols, but sequences of strings as well. Given a sequence x_1 x_2 x_3 ... x_n of positive integers, the Gödel encoding is the product of the first n primes raised to their corresponding values in the sequence:

\rm{enc}(x_1 x_2 x_3 ... x_n) = 2^{x_1}\cdot 3^{x_2}\cdot 5^{x_3}\cdot ...\cdot {p_n}^{x_n}

According to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, any code obtained this way can be uniquely factored into prime factors, so it is possible to recover the original sequence.
See also a more sophisticated (but more “concise”) way to construct  Gödel numbering for sequences.

Gödel specifically used this scheme at two levels: first, to encode sequences of symbols representing formulas, and second, to encode sequences of formulas representing proofs. This allowed him to show a correspondence between statements about natural numbers and statements about the provability of theorems about natural numbers, the key observation of the proof.

Discussion
This Gödel numbering is not unique.  The general idea is to map formulas onto natural numbers.  An alternative Gödel numbering could be to consider each of the symbols of Step 1 to be mapped (through, say, a mapping ''h'') to a digit of a Radix|base-22 numeral system, so a formula  consisting of a string of ''n'' symbols  s_1 s_2 s_3 \dots s_n would be mapped to the number

: h(s_1) \times 22^{(n-1)} + h(s_2) \times 22^{(n-2)} + \cdots + h(s_{n-1}) \times 22^1 + h(s_n) \times 
22^0. 

Also, Gödel numbering implies that each rule of inference|inference rule of the formal system can be expressed as a function of natural numbers.  If ''f'' is the Gödel mapping and if formula ''C'' can be derived from formulas ''A'' and ''B'' through an inference rule ''r'', i.e.

: A, B \vdash_r C, \ 

then there should be some arithmetical function ''gr'' of natural numbers such that
: g_r(f(A),h(B)) = f(C). \ 
Then, since the formal system is a formal arithmetic, which can make statements about numbers and their arithmetical relationships to each other, it follows that the system can also, by means of Gödel coding, indirectly make statements about itself: that is, a proposition of the formal system can make assertions which, when viewed through the perspective of the Gödel mapping, translate into assertions about other propositions of the same formal system, or even about itself.  Thus, by this means a formal arithmetic can make assertions about itself, becoming self-reference|self-referential, almost like a second-order logic.  This provided Gödel (and other logicians) with a means of exploring and discovering proofs about consistency and completeness properties of formal systems.
