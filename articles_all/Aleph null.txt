'''Aleph null''' (also '''aleph naught''' or '''aleph 0''') is the smallest infinite number. It is the cardinality (size) of the set of natural numbers (there are aleph null natural numbers). Georg Cantor invented and named the concept. The symbol for aleph null is \aleph_0.  

It is the first infinite number in a series of infinite Cardinal number|cardinal numbers. In fact, it is the size of any set which can be matched with the natural numbers.

Aleph null is followed by aleph one, an infinite number represented by the symbol \aleph_1.
