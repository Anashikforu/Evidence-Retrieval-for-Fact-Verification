A '''quart''' is a unit of measurement for volume.  It is a quarter of a gallon or two pints.  Because the Imperial unit|imperial system and the U.S. customary units|American system use different gallons, their quarts are different.

Variants
In the American system, there are two different quarts. There is a wet quart and a dry quart. There is only one imperial quart. One U.S. dry quart is smaller than one imperial quart.
