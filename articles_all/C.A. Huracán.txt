Huracán was founded on November 1, 1908, in the Nueva Pompeya neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. The club's name and nickname (''Globo'', literally "Balloon") come from the ''Huracán'' Balloon (aircraft)|balloon flied by Jorge Newbery in 1909. Apart from that, club supporters are called ''los Quemeros'' ("the Burners") because the stadium is in a former garbage burning area.

During the professional era, Huracán won the Argentine Primera División|Primera División title just once (the 1973 Argentine Primera División#Campeonato Metropolitano|1973 Metropolitano), and obtained 4 titles during the Amateur era in Argentine football|amateur era (in 1921, 1922, 1925 and 1928).

History
Though officially founded in 1908, there are documents that tell about a previous foundation on May 25, 1903. During the Amateur era in Argentine football|amateur era of Argentine football (1891–1930), Huracán won four championships (1921 in Argentine football|1921, 1922 in Argentine football|1922, 1925 in Argentine football|1925 and 1928 in Argentine football|1928). The team was the fifth most successful during that period.

During the professional era (started in 1931), Huracán had their moment of glory in the Metropolitano championship|''Metropolitano'' championship of the 1973 Argentine Primera División|1973 season, when they won their only Argentine Primera División|first division title. The team has also won twice the Primera B Nacional|second division (1989–90 and 1999–00). The club has had 4 Promotion and relegation|promotions and relegations during their history. The last promotion came during the 2006–07 season, when Huracán defeated Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba|Godoy Cruz in the promotion playoffs.

Huracán was runner-up of the Primera División in the 2008–09 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Clausura|2009 Clausura. The team, coached by Ángel Cappa and with Mario Bolatti, Matías Defederico and Javier Pastore as key players, was praised for their attacking short-pass style of play.



Stadium

The Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó was closed in May 2008, after cracks were discovered in one of the structural columns. While the stadium was out of commission, Huracán played their home games at Argentinos Juniors. In August 2008, Fernando "la tota" Blauzwirn, an old player from the 1940s correctly said "no veo la hora de volver al Ducó, qué sufrimiento muyayo!" (I cannot wait until returning to the Duco, guys, what a suffering!).

On 13 December 2008 during the final weekend of the 2008-09 Apertura championship, Huracán returned to the Ducó, 438 days after they'd last played there. Their 3-0 victory against Vélez was the only game Huracan played at home during their centenary year.
