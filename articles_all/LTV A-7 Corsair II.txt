The '''A-7 Corsair II''' was an attack plane like the F-8 Crusader. It was made by Ling-Temco-Vought. It first flew in 1965, and went into militaries in 1967. It can take off from aircraft carriers, and can carry bombs meant to destroy enemies on the ground.

Note that it is called the "Corsair II" because there was an airplane called the F4U Corsair.
