The United States Constitution was also written there.  It served as the capital of the United States several times, mostly during the Revolutionary War.  It was also the meeting place of the state legislature of Pennsylvania.  It is a World Heritage Site.  It is on the back of the $100 bill.

The Liberty Bell was originally in the bell tower of the building.
