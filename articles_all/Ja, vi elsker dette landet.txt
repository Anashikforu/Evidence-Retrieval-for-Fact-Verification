Metrical English translation

:Norway, thine is our devotion,
:Land of hearth and home,
:Rising storm-scarred from the ocean,
:Where the breakers foam.
:Often thee our thoughts are wending,
:Land that gave us birth,
:And to saga nights still sending
:Dreams upon our earth.
::And to saga nights still sending
::Dreams upon us on our earth!
: -
:Men of Norway, be your dwelling
:Cottage, house or farm,
:Praise the Lord who all compelling
:Saved our land from harm.
:Not the valour of a father
:On the battlefield
:Nor a mother's tears, but rather
:God our victory sealed.
::Nor a mother's tears, but rather
::God for us our victory sealed.
: -
:Norway, thine is our devotion,
:Land of hearth and home,
:Rising storm-scarred from the ocean,
:Where the breakers foam.
:As our fathers' victory gave it:
:"Peace for one and all."
:We shall rally, too, to save it
:When we hear the call.
::We shall rally, too, to save it
::When we hear, we hear the call!
