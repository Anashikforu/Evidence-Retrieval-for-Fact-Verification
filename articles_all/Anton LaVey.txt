Early life
LaVey was born Howard Stanton Levey in Chicago, Illinois to a Jewish family of Ukrainian descent. 
Church of Satan
In the 1960s, LaVey began giving lectures at his house to a group of people he called his "Magic Circle." A member of this Circle told him that his ideas could become a religion. He agreed, and founded the Church of Satan in 1966. In 1969, he published ''The Satanic Bible''. ''The Satanic Bible'' was a collection of writings he had published in the past years that outlined his philosophies and the basics of the religion. It was influenced by Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, H. L. Mencken, and other authors and philosophers. In 1971, LaVey published ''The Compleat Witch'' (later released as ''The Satanic Witch''). ''The Satanic Witch'' was a manual of magic. In 1972, LaVey published ''The Satanic Rituals''. This contained instructions for performing rituals. In the 1990s, LaVey published two books of essays, ''The Devil's Notebook'' and ''Satan Speaks''.

Death
LaVey died on October 29, 1997. His death was caused by pulmonary edema (fluid in his lungs). This was brought on by his heart disease.
