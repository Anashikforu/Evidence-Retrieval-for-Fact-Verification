An '''acronym''' is a word whose letters are the first letters of other words. People often create a short acronym that means the same thing as a much longer phrase (set of words).  This is faster and shorter to say then the long phrase.  

Examples of acronyms are:

 COBOL - '''CO'''mmon '''B'''usiness '''O'''riented '''L'''anguage
 LASER - '''L'''ight '''A'''mplification through '''S'''timulated '''E'''mmission of '''R'''adiation
 POSH - '''P'''ort '''o'''ut '''s'''tarboard '''h'''ome
 QUANGO - '''Qu'''asi-'''a'''utonomous '''n'''on-'''g'''overnmental '''o'''rganisation
 RADAR - '''RA'''dio '''D'''etecting '''A'''nd '''R'''anging
 SARS  - '''S'''evere '''A'''cute '''R'''espiratory '''S'''yndrome
 SCUBA - '''S'''elf-'''C'''ontained '''U'''nderwater '''B'''reathing '''A'''pparatus
 SNAFU - '''S'''ituation '''N'''ormal: '''A'''ll '''F'''ouled '''U'''p

An acronym usually must be able to be spoken as word. Other abbreviations such as ASAP ('''N'''ational '''B'''asketball '''A'''ssociation) have combinations of letters that are not pronounced as a single word. People just say the letters, one after another.  

These three-letter acronyms, and some more obscure four-letter ones such as ISDN are more often called initialisms.

The word "acronym" comes from the Greek acro ‘extreme’ and onymus ‘name’.

Extremes
