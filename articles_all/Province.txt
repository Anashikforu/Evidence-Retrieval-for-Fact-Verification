A '''province''' is a subdivision of a country. It is a kind of local government.

Some countries are divided into '''provinces'''. The word "province" comes from the Latin word ''provincia''.

South Africa, Canada, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Spain, and Denmark are examples of countries that are divided into provinces.

In some countries, provinces have different names:

 Departments of France|Département: France
 Cantons of Switzerland|Canton: Switzerland
 State: United States, Mexico, Brazil, Australia
 States of Germany|Bundesland: Germany and Austria
 Voivodship: Poland
 District: Serbia (''okrug''), Belize, Bhutan 
 Prefectures of Japan|Prefectures (県): Japan 
 States of Venezuela|Estados: Venezuela
 County: United Kingdom
 Suba: Pakistan
 Pradesh: the Hindi word for states: Republic of India
 Fylke: Norway
 Parish: Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago
Departements usually have less power than provinces. States, Bundesländer and autonomous communities have more power than provinces.

Small countries like Singapore or Monaco are not divided.
