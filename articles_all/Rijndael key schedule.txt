The '''Rijndael key schedule''' (AES) uses a key schedule to expand a short key into a number of separate round keys.

The three AES variants have a different number of rounds. Each variant requires a separate 128-bit round key for each round plus one more. The key schedule produces the needed round keys from the initial key.
