Meaning of the word “chromatic”

The word “chromatic” comes from the Ancient Greek language|Greek word “chromos” meaning “color”.  Pipe organ|Organists in the 16th century|16th and 17th century|17th centuries such as Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck|Sweelinck liked to write “Chromatic Fantasias”.  These were pieces based on tunes which were chromatic.  In those days, because of the musical tuning|tuning systems used, not all the semitones were exactly the same size.  Going up a chromatic scale would have been like walking up a staircase with steps which were slightly larger or smaller in depth.  This made chromatic scales very interesting and “colourful” which is why they were called “chromatic”.

Chromatic harmony

'''Chromatic harmony''' means harmony (chords) which use notes which do not belong to the tonality|key the music is in (they are not in the key signature).  Although Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach in the 18th century used chromatic harmony it was the 19th century composers who used it more and more.  Richard Wagner|Wagner wrote music which was very chromatic: there were lots of sharps and flats and it kept modulating to different key areas.  The chord at the beginning of his opera ''Tristan und Isolde|Tristan and Isolde'' is so famous that it is known as the ''Tristan chord''.  It is very chromatic.  The music is full of tension because it leaves us wondering which key the music is in.
