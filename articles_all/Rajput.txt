'''Rajput'''s constitute one of the major Hindu Kshatriya groups from India. They claim descent from ancient royal warrior Dynasty|dynasties of Kshatriyas. They are identified with the word "Rajanya" found in ancient Indian literature and trace their roots to Rajputana or Rajputstan (India). In ancient times the son of a king was referred as to Rajput- '''Raja-putra'''. (Lit - king's son - Prince)

The Rajputs consist of 36 different clans. These are divided into three different lines of descent (called vanshas). They are:
# Suryavanshi - descendants of the sun god, Surya.
# Chandravanshi - descendants of the moon god, Chandra.
# Agnivanshi - descendants of the fire god, Agni.
