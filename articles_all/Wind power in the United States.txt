This amounted to 94,650 thousand megawatt-hours of electricity.Electric Power Monthly - April 2011, Table 1.1A

Driven by state renewable energy mandates, fourteen states have installed over 1,000&nbsp;MW of wind capacity, and a total of 37&nbsp;states now have installed at least some large-scale wind power. Wind power in Texas|Texas, with 10,135&nbsp;MW of capacity, has the most installed wind power capacity of any U.S. state, followed by Wind power in Iowa|Iowa with 3,675&nbsp;MW. The Roscoe Wind Farm (781&nbsp;MW) in Wind power in Texas|Texas is the largest wind farm in the US as of 2011.
