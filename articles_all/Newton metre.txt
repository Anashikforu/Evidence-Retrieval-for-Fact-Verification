The '''Newton metre''' is the Unit of Measurement|unit of Moment (physics)|moment in the SI system Standard International.  It is abbreviated '''N·m''', and sometimes written with hyphen ''newton-metre''. It is a compound unit of torque  corresponding to the torque from a Force (physics)|force of one newton (unit)|newton applied over a distance arm of one metre.

A newton metre is dimensionally equivalent to a joule.
