The '''Pontifical Academy of Sciences''' dates back four centuries to its creation as the '''Accademia dei Lincei''' in 1603. Pope Pius IX changed the name to the '''Pontifical Academy of the New Lincei''' in 1847 to signify its new status as an official institution of the Pontifical State.
 Mission 
Although it reports directly to the Pontiff, the academy has considerable freedom in conducting its mission: the study of Science and the possible consequences for the human condition. Christian belief is not a prerequisite for membership to the academy, because first and foremost, it is a legitimate Scientific body that follows the Scientific Method. As of 2003 more than two dozen Nobel Prize winners (including Professor Ahmed Zewail, Chemistry 1999) and several Field Medal winners were counted as members.
 Reorganization 
 ''In multis solaciis'', issued 28 October 1936 by Pope Pius XI, on the topic of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences
