Originally the word ''''ghetto'''' meant the Jewish quarter of Venice, and later of any European town.  Many places had a ghetto.  The term "ghetto" is now commonly used to refer to any poverty-stricken urban area with a concentration of minority groups.  The word has a few possible sources:
 "getto", the Venice|Venetian word for foundry slag, because the Jews were only allowed in the area where the iron foundries were.  
 Others believe it is from the Italian word ''borghetto'', meaning a little ''borgo'' or ‘borough’.''The New Oxford American Dictionary, Second Edition'', Erina McKean, Oxford University Press, 

It is also used to refer to areas that are considered to be undesirable.
