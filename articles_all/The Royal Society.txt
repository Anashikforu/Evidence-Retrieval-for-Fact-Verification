'''The Royal Society''' is a society for science and scientists.Full title: The Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge. It was founded in 1660 by Charles II of England|Charles II. It is the oldest  society of its kind still in existence.

 History 
A Royal Charter, on 15 July 1662, created "The Royal Society of London".

William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker|Lord Brouncker was the first President of the Royal Society|President, and Robert Hooke was Curator of Experiments. The reigning monarch has always been the patron of the Royal Society since its foundation.

The motto of the Royal Society is ''Nullius in Verba'' (Latin: nothing in words).The full quote from Horace - "Nullius addictus judicare in verba magistri" - expands into the gold standard of objectivity: "Not compelled to swear to any master's words". This shows the Society's commitment to establishing scientific truth through experiment rather than by quoting authority.

Although this seems obvious today, the philosophical basis of the Royal Society differed from previous philosophies such as scholasticism, which established scientific truth based on deductive logic, concordance with divine providence and the citation of such ancient authorities as Aristotle.

 Fellows 
The members of the society are called '''Fellows of the Royal Society''', and put the letters '''FRS''' Post-nominal letters|after their names. There are usually about 1600 of them. They are elected by existing Fellows. All other posts, such as the Secretary and President, are also by election.
