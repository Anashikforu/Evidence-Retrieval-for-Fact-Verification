History


Orion was first made for the Constellation program in 2004, as the '''Orion CEV (Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle)'''. It was meant to be launched on the Ares I rocket. Then it would be able to go to the International Space Station. It was also planned to go to a spacecraft launched in pieces on different Ares V rockets, and the spacecraft with the Orion would go to the Moon, Mars, or another place.

On October 11, 2010, Constellation was cancelled. They created a new program and a new rocket called the Space Launch System, and changed the name of Orion to the '''Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle'''. This rocket will launch Orion for going to the Moon in 2022 and Mars in 2033.
