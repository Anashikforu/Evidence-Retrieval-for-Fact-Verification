History
The first people to live in the Forbes area were the Indigenous Australians|Australian aborigines, the Wiradjuri people.  The first European was the explorer John Oxley in 1817. He called the area "Camp Hill". The first settlers moved into the district in 1834 and started a station (farm) called ''Bogabigal''. Forbes is built on what was Arthur Rankin's farm called ''Cunumbla'' Station.

Gold was found at Forbes by Harry Stephens, also known as "German Harry", in June 1861. About 30,000 people moved to the goldfields, but by 1863 this had dropped to about 3,500 because mining the gold was too hard. The diggings were wet with water coming from the Lachlan River. About two thirds of the buildings were empty.

The goldfields were first called "Black Ridge". The town was named "Forbes" after Sir Francis Forbes. It is possible that the name was a mistake. The name Forbes should have been given to Hill End, New South Wales near Mudgee, New South Wales|Mudgee. Gold was found there at the same time. Gold at Forbes was first found in the area known as Halpin's Flat. The Albion Hotel, once a Cobb and Co. stage coach rest stop, has tunnels underneath it. These were used to take gold and money to and from the banks and stop it from being stolen. Farming became important after the gold mining ended. Forbes became an important stopping place on the main track for moving cattle from Queensland to Victoria (Australia)|Victoria.

One of Australia's most famous bushrangers, Ben Hall, was shot dead by police about 20kilometres|km northwest of town on May 5, 1865. Hall and his gang were famous for stealing 77kilogram|kg of gold and Â£3,700 from a stage coach near the town of Eugowra, New South Wales|Eugowra in 1862. He is buried in the Forbes Cemetery.
