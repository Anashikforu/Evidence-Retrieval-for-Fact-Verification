Designated '''Uranus&nbsp;XVI''' it was named after the monster fictional character in William Shakespeare's play ''The Tempest''.

The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong, together with Stephano (moon)|Stephano to the same dynamic cluster, suggesting common origin.

The diameter is estimated at 72&nbsp;km (assuming albedo of 0.04), making it the second biggest non-spherical moon of Uranus, half the size of Sycorax (moon)|Sycorax, the biggest non-spherical moon of Uranus.

The light curve suggests Caliban's rotation period is 2.7 hours.
