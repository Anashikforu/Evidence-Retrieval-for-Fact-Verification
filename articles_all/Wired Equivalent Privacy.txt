'''Wired Equivalent Privacy''' (also known as '''WEP''') is a standard to use encryption in Wireless LANs. It was introduced in 1999. 

In 2001, mathematicians showed that WEP is not very strong. A WEP connection could be Cryptanalysis|decoded, with software that can be easily found, within minutes. 

Even though it only offers low security, WEP is still widely in use.

People sometimes call it ''Wireless Encryption Protocol'', which is wrong.
