A '''hearing aid''' is a small electrical machine which fits in or behind a person's ear. The purpose of a hearing aid is to make sounds louder so the person can hear spoken words and other sounds.

The two most common types of modern hearing aids are ''behind the ear aids'' and ''in the ear aids''.

Before hearing aids were invented, people used "ear trumpets" also called Horn (acoustic)|ear horns.Comparison of Hearing Aids Over the 20th Century. Ear & Hearing. 21(6):625-639, December 2000.

 Types of hearing aids 
There are many different types of hearing aids.  They are good for different users depending on lifestyle and how much help they need to hear.  An audiologist can help make hearing aids work even better for a user by customising them. 

In-The-Canal (ITC) - the smallest type of hearing aid, these are made to fit inside the ear canal and can be used by people with mild to moderate hearing loss
In-The-Ear (ITE) - these are slightly larger than the ITC aids and fit inside the outer ear instead of the canal.  These can be used by people with mild to severe hearing loss
Behind-The-Ear (BTE) - sit behind the ear and connect to a mould placed in your ear through a tube.  This type of aid is usually the largest but can be used by almost anyone with hearing loss and has many different functions
