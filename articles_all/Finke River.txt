The '''Finke River''' is one of the largest rivers in central Australia. It starts in the MacDonnell Ranges in the Northern Territory. it is formed where Davenport and Ormiston Creeks join together, just north of Glen Helen.
The Finke River was named by John McDouall Stuart in 1860 after William Finke, an Adelaide man, who was one of the people who paid part of the cost of his expeditions.
Age of the Finke River
The Finke River has been called "''the oldest river in the world''", particularly by tour operators, and in popular books and brochures. In places such as the James Range, the Finke flows through deeply Meanders|incised meanders  
The age of the Finke River is not unique. There are other large mountain-sourced river systems in central Australia including the Todd River|Todd and Hale Rivers where the mountains were formed at the same time. There are other mountain ranges of equal or greater age to the MacDonnell Ranges, both in Australia and on other continents. The rivers in those areas may have evolved from ancestral streams of the same age or older than the Finke.
