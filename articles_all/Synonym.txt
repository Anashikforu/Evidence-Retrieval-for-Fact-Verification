Synonyms can be nouns, verbs, adverbs or adjectives, but both words must be of the same part of speech. That means, only a noun can be a synonym of another noun, only a verb can be a synonym of another verb, and so on.

One can find sets of synonyms in a thesaurus, which is a book listing groups of related words.

Some words are near-synonyms, which have similar but not exactly the same meaning.

 History

The meaning of the word has remained unchanged for all these centuries. There is even a saying, going back to 1892, ''"Once a synonym, always a synonym"''.
