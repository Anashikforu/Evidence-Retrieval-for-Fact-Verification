'''An emergency medical technician''' ('''EMT''') is someone who works on an ambulance and takes care of illness|sick and hurt people. EMTs used to be called "ambulance drivers," since much of their work is bringing people to an emergency room. Their other main duty is first aid including:
 Doing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and give Defibrillation|electric shocks to a person's chest if their heart is beating in a way that could kill them
 Giving oxygen (or force oxygen into a person's lungs) if they stop breathing or are Respiratory failure|not breathing well enough to survive
 Inserting a breathing tube down someone's windpipe to help them breathe better. 
 Stopping Hemorrhage|hemorrhaging (bleeding so bad that it will kill a person if not stopped)
 Treating burns 
 Treat very bad physical trauma (injuries)
 Helping people who are Pregnancy|pregnant give birth
 Treating Bone fracture|broken bones, dislocated joints, sprains, and wounds

 In the United States 
In the United States, each state decides what their EMTs can do. EMTs in every state are allowed to perform first aid. Each state has different rules for exactly what their EMTs can do. These rules are called ''treatment protocols''. For example:
 In Massachusetts, EMTs can give Medication|medicines to treat Myocardial infarction|heart attacks, breathing emergencies (like asthma attacks), anaphylaxis, very Hypoglycemia|low blood sugar, and overdoses on Opioid|opiates like heroin and oxycodone.
 In New Hampshire, EMTs are allowed to place a rescue airway in a patient who cannot breathe.  This means they will place a tube down the patient's throat, then force oxygen into the lungs through the tube.
