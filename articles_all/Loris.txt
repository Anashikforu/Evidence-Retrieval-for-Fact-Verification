The '''Lorises''' are solitary mammals that live in tropical rainforests in southeast Asia. The loris is arboreal, living in trees. It is nocturnal, most active at night. In captivity, the loris lives for up to 13 years.

The loris is a group of primates. They are closely related to galagos and slightly less closely related to lemurs. 

The loris has enormous eyes, grasping fingers, and toes with opposable digits. The loris ranges from 7 to 15 inches (18 to 38&nbsp;cm) long. It has a stubby tail, only about 1 inch (3&nbsp;cm) long.

The loris is an omnivore (eating plants and animals); it eats mostly insects, lizards, fruits, and some plant shoots.
