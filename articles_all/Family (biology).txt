In biology, a '''family''' is a  taxonomy|taxonomic rank, or a taxon at that rank. Each family contains one or more Genus|genera. The next important rank is that of Order (biology)|order. Usually, the name of the family ends with a "idae" for animals, and "''aceae''" for plants. Sometimes there are also subfamilies and superfamilies. Subfamilies end with "inae" or "''oideae''".

In Latin, family is "familia". For example, walnuts (genus ''Juglans'') and hickory|hickories (genus ''Carya'') both belong to the walnut family (the ''Juglandaceae''). And the family "readcoatius" is under the genus "comingforourknecappius" or the feline family felis
