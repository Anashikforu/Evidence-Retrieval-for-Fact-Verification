In geometry, a '''digon'''  is a polygon with two sides (edge (geometry)|edges) and two Vertex (geometry)|vertices. Its construction is Degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate in a Euclidean plane because either the two sides would coincide or one or both would have to be curved; however, it can be #In elementary polyhedra|easily visualised in elliptic space.

A regular digon has both angles equal and both sides equal and is represented by Schl√§fli symbol {2}. It may be constructed on a spherical geometry|sphere as a pair of 180 degree arcs connecting antipodal points, when it forms a spherical lune|lune.

The digon is the simplest abstract polytope of rank 2.

A truncation (geometry)|truncated ''digon'', t{2} is a square, {4}. An Alternation (geometry)|alternated digon, h{2} is a monogon, {1}.
