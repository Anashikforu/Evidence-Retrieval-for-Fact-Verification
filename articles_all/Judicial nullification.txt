During the Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention many, including George Mason, Elbridge Gerry and James Wilson felt the courts could decide if a law was unconstitutional, and if so, refuse to enforce it.W. Trickett, 'Judicial Nullification of Acts of Congress', ''The North American Review'', Vol. 185, No. 621 (Aug. 16, 1907), pp. 849â€“850 Other founding fathers including John Francis Mercer, Gouverneur Morris and John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson argued against allowing judges to have that power. The issue was left unanswered. However, when deciding that a new law needed the approval of the President of the United States|president, all attempts to have the judiciary approve new laws were soundly defeated. Judicial Nullification is sometimes used to mean jury nullification. More often it means nullifying a law, legal code or statute by a member of the judiciary.
