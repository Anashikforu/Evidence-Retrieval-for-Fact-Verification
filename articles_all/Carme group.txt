The '''Carme group''' is a group of retrograde and direct motion|retrograde non-Sphere|spherical moons of Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Carme and are thought to have a common origin.

Their semi-major axis|semi-major axes (distances from Jupiter) range between 22,900,000 and 24,100,000&nbsp;km, their inclinations between 164.9° and 165.5°, and their eccentricity|orbital eccentricities between 0.23 and 0.27 (with one exception).
Image:TheIrregulars JUPITER GROUPS.svg|thumb|300px|This diagram illustrates the largest irregular satellites of Jupiter. The location of the Carme group is illustrated by Carme's presence in the lower middle. An object's position on the horizontal axis indicates its distance from Jupiter. The vertical axis indicates its orbital inclination|inclination. Orbital eccentricity|Eccentricity is indicated by yellow bars illustrating the object's maximum and minimum distances from Jupiter. Circles illustrate an object's size in comparison to the others.

The core members include (from biggest to smallest):

Image:TheIrregulars JUPITER Carme CORE.svg|thumb|right|300px|This diagram compares the orbital elements and relative sizes of the core members of the Carme group. The horizontal axis illustrates their average distance from Jupiter, the vertical axis their orbital inclination, and the circles their relative sizes.

Origin
The Carme group may once have been a single body that was broken apart by an impact. Further support to the single body origin comes from the known colours: all the moons appear light red,Grav, Tommy; Holman, Matthew J.; Gladman, Brett J.; Aksnes, Kaare ''Photometric survey of the irregular satellites'', Icarus, '''166''',(2003), pp. 33-45. and infrared electromagnetic spectrum|spectra, similar to D-type asteroids.
