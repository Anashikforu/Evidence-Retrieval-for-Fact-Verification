Bayonet charge
18th century|18th and 19th century military tactics included the use of a bayonet fixed on the infantryman's musket.''
With the use of the bayonet, the pike was no longer used because infantry could now defend themselves from cavalry without sacrificing firepower per man. The Russian Army used the bayonet frequently during the Napoleonic wars. A Russian saying coined by Russian General Alexander Suvorov was "The bullet is foolish, the bayonet wise".Sir Basil Henry Liddell Hart, ''The Soviet Army'' (London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1957), p. 18 Given Russia's often poorly trained armies and inaccurate smoothbore muskets, Russian officers preferred to use the bayonet charge instead of musket volley fire where possible.
