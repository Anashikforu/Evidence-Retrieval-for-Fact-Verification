'''Haptophytes''' are a phylum of algae, sometimes called the '''Prymnesiophyta'''.R.A. Anderson. 2004. Biology and systematics of heterokont and haptophyte algae. ''American Journal of Botany'' '''91''': 1508-1522. 
The cells typically have two slightly unequal flagella and a unique organelle called a '''haptonema'''. This is superficially similar to a flagellum, but differs in its arrangement of microtubules, and in its use. The name comes from the Greek language|Greek ''hapsis'' = touch, and ''nema'' = thread. 

 Classification 
Molecular evolution|Molecular and Morphology (biology)|morphological evidence places them in five orders; coccolithophores make up the ''Isochrysidales'' and ''Coccolithales''. Other groups include phytoplankton which produce the toxic Algae|algal blooms.
