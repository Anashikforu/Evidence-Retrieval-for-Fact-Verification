'''Cuttlebone''' is a hard wikt:brittle|brittle structure found inside cuttlefish. It is made mainly of calcium carbonate. The cuttlefish use it to control floating. Cuttlebones have been used to make polishing powder. This was then added to toothpaste. Today, cuttlebone is mainly used for caged birds and turtles in their habitats, so they get their calcium easily and fast.
