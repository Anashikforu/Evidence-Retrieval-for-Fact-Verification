'''Static random-access memory''' ('''SRAM''') is a type of RAM that keeps data that is fed to it without having to be refreshed over and over again. 

Both DRAM and SRAM store information in binary by using very small electronic components. Both are Non-volatile random-access memory|volatile (need electric current flowing to keep the negative and positive electric charge|charged components stay that way).

One difference is that SRAM are also used for specific applications within the personal computer|PC, where their good points outweigh their bad points compared to DRAM.

Like other semiconductor chips, SRAM chips are made by photolithography. 

For SRAM, each bit is composed of between four and six transistors, forming a Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop to hold information. This complexity is what makes SRAM bigger and more expensive than DRAM. In DRAM each bit has only one transistor plus a capacitor acting like a miniature rechargeable battery).

Good differences
 SRAM does not need to be refreshed.
 Changing Static RAM is faster than DRAM.

Bad differences
 SRAM is more expensive than DRAM. 
 SRAMs take up more space and electricity.
