'''43 Ariadne''' is a fairly big and bright Asteroid belt|main belt asteroid. It is the second-biggest member of the Flora family|Flora asteroid family. It was found by Norman Robert Pogson|N. R. Pogson on April 15, 1857 and named after the Greek mythology|Greek heroine Ariadne.

 Characteristics 
Ariadne is very stretched out (almost twice as long as its smallest shape). It is a Prograde and retrograde motion|retrograde rotator, although its pole points almost parallel to the ecliptic towards ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (-15°, 235°) with a 10° uncertainty#Kaasalainen02|2. This gives an axial tilt of about 105°.

 Trivia 
 For reasons unknown, "Asteroid 43 Ariadne" was included in a list of names of supporters of the NASA spacecraft Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust that was stored on a microchip within the spacecraft.
 The maximum apparent size of Ariadne is equal to the maximum apparent size of Pluto.
