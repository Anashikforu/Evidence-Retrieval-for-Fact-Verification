A '''goitre''' or '''goiter''' (Latin: ''struma''), also called a '''bronchocele''', is a inflammation|swelling in the neck (just below Adam's apple or larynx).  It happens when the thyroid gland gets larger (usually because Iodine deficiency|the body is not getting enough iodine). 



 Classification 
Goitres are classification|classified in different ways (put into different categories): 

 A ''diffuse goitre'' is a goitre that has spread through all of the thyroid.  A diffuse goitre can be a "simple goitre" or a "multi nodular goitre."
 ''Toxic goiter'' is a goitre with hyperthyroidism.  These most commonly caused by Graves disease, but they can also be caused by inflammation or a multinodular goitre.
 Any other type of goitre is called a ''non-toxic goitre''.  These may be caused by lithium, some kinds of autoimmune diseases, or other problems.  People with non-toxic goiters have low thyroid levels (hypothyroidism) or normal thyroid levels.

 Causes 

Some of the causes of goitre include:
 Thyroid cancer
 Iodine deficiency (not having enough iodine in the body)
 Hashimoto's thyroiditis
 Graves-Basedow disease
 Congenital defect|Congenital hypothyroidism (hypothyroidism that babies have when they are born, caused by errors in the way the body makes thyroid hormone)
 Thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland)
 Side Effects|Side effects of certain medications

New research says that some people may be more vulnerable to goitre (more likely to have goiters) because they heredity|inherited that vulnerability (it was passed down to them from their parents).

 Famous goitre sufferers 
 Within two years of each other, President George H. W. Bush and his wife Barbara Bush (First Lady)|Barbara Bush both were diagnosed with Graves disease and larger-than-normal thyroid glands.  President Bush's disease caused hyperthyroidism and cardiac dysrhythmia (irregular heart rate).
