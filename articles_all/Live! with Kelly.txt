'''''Live! with Kelly and Ryan''''' is a syndicated United States|American television talk show, hosted by Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest.

The show began in 1983 as a local New York City program called ''The Morning Show'', hosted by Regis Philbin and Cyndy Garvey (then the wife of Major League Baseball player Steve Garvey).
In 2001, Ripa was named as Philbin's co-host, with the show then being renamed '''''Live! with Regis and Kelly'''''. Philbin and Ripa remained a team until 2011; in January of that year, he announced he was leaving the show, with his last show airing on November 18. The show then became '''''Live! with Kelly''''', with Ripa appearing with a wide array of guest co-hosts. Former New York Giants star defensive lineman Strahan became the new full-time co-host effective with the 2012â€“13 season premiere. At that point the show became '''''Live! with Kelly and Michael.'''''

''Live!'s'' mixture of A-list guests and the interaction between co-hosts have made it one of daytime's most popular and venerable talk shows.

In 2016, Strahan announced he was leaving the show to join Good Morning America. Seacrest began hosting in 2017.
