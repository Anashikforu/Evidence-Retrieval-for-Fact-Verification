'''Friedrich August von Hayek''', Order of the Companions of Honour|CH (8 May 1899 – 23 March 1992) was an Austrian-United Kingdom|British economist and politics|political Philosophy|philosopher. He became known because he strongly defended liberalism and free market|free-market capitalism. He was against too much central control of the economy and society. He thought that forms of government like socialism were not good for the economy, and damaged freedom of the individual. Hayek's signature work, ''The Road to Serfdom'', refers to the consequences of socialism.

He was one of the most important economists and political philosophers of the 20th century.Edward Feser (ed) 2007. ''The Cambridge Companion to Hayek''. Cambridge University Press. p13  He was one of the most important members of the Austrian School of economics. He also had many ideas in the fields of jurisprudence and cognitive science. He shared the 1974 Nobel Prize in Economics with his rival Gunnar Myrdal. The award was for their work in the Monetary policy|theory of money and Business cycle|economic fluctuations; also for their analysis of the inter-dependence of economic, society|social and institutional phenomena. He is thought to be one of the major causes of change from the Keynesian economics|Keynesian policies of the first part of the 20th century. Instead of governments handling the details of the economy, they went back towards classical liberalism in the 1980s and later. This happened most clearly in the 1980s in the U.S.A. (under Ronald Reagan) and the U.K. (under Margaret Thatcher).
