'''Faggot''' (or '''fag''') is a derogatory term for a homosexual human. It is usually used to refer to gay men, but may also be used for lesbian women.Joyce in Nighttown: A Psychoanalytic Inquiry Into Ulysses - Page 221, Mark Shechner - 1974  Many people, especially homosexuals, see it as hate speech. Typically, they prefer the term gay, or sometimes queer; queer having been reclaimed by the LGBTQ+ community despite the term's pre-existing negative connotation.

Younger generations (including by LGBT people) often use the term "gay", "fag" and "faggot" as an insult towards people that annoy them without actually linking the word to homosexuals.
