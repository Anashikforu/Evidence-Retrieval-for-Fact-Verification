'''Bottom quarks''' or '''beauty quarks''' are the second most Mass|massive of the elementary particles (particles that are so small that they can not be divided any more). All quarks are elementary particles. Bottom quarks have a Electromagnetism|charge of -1/3, similar to down quarks. Although bottom quarks are not very common, they are found in particles such as B mesons, among others. All bottom quarks will Radioactive decay|decay into charm quarks or up quarks in about 10â€“12, due to weak force.
