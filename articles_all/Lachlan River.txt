The river starts in the central mountains of New South Wales, near Gunning, New South Wales|Gunning. Other rivers that join the Lachlan River are the Carcoar River|Boorowa River, the Belubula River and the Abercrombie River. They join the Lachlan near the town of Cowra, New South Wales|Cowra. 

Wyangala Dam was built near Cowra to control the amount of water in the river.  The Lachlan does not get its water from melting snow like the Murrumbidgee River or the Murray River. It does not have a regular amount of water flowing down it. In 1944 the flow was less than 1,000 megalitres (810 acre foot|acre-feet). Six years later (1950) there was a flow of 10,900,000 megalitres (8.8 million acre feet). In dry years, for example April 1944 to April 1945, the Lachlan may have no water flowing in it at all. The Lachlan has flooded every 7 years since 1887 at Forbes, New South Wales|Forbes.

The Lachlan River flows west and then south, finishes in the Great Cumbung swamp. This swamp is near Oxley, New South Wales|Oxley between Hay, New South Wales|Hay and Balranald, New South Wales|Balranald. Water from this big (500 kmÂ²) swamp finally goes into the Murrumbidgee River. Water from the Lachlan is used for farming.

History
The Lachlan river is in the area where the Indigenous Australians|aboriginal people called the Wiradjuri lived.

The first European to find the Lachlan River in 1815 was Acting-Surveyor George William Evans. He named the river after Lachlan Macquarie, the Governor of New South Wales. The Lachlan River was explored by John Oxley in 1817.Reed, A. W., ''Place-names of New South Wales: Their Origins and Meanings (Reed: 1969).''

In the early days of New South Wales, the south part of the Lachlan was known as ''Fish River''. With more exploration it was realized that two rivers were the same river and the name Fish River was dropped.

In 1870 the river flooded. The top of the flood water was measured at 15.9 metres at Cowra.

Now indigenous and white people live on the Lachlan river.

 Economy 
More than 100,000 people live in the Lachlan area. 14% of NSW farm goods come from the area which is about 10% of NSW. 24 Local Government Areas of New South Wales|local governments look after the Lachlan area.
