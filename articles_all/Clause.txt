A '''clause''' is a part of a sentence. Each clause is made up of a Subject (grammar)|subject (who or what the sentence is about) and a Predicate (grammar)|predicate (what happens in a sentence). Each predicate has only one main verb. ''I love you'' is a sentence which has only one clause. ''I love you and I will always love you'' is a sentence which has two clauses. The two clauses are ''I love you'' and ''I will always love you''. These clauses are joined together by the word ''and'', which is a conjunction). Clauses may be independent or dependent.

 In use 
Two clauses can be joined with a pronoun. For example: ''I live in London, which is in England''. Here, ''I live in London'' is the first clause, and ''which is in England'' is the second clause. The word ''which'' is a pronoun which takes the place of ''London''. It joins the two clauses. A sentence can contain many clauses. But sentences with fewer clauses are easier to understand.

 Dependent and independent clauses 
A simple sentence may also be called an independent clause. It may be a part of a Sentence|compound or complex sentence, but it can also stand on its own as a simple sentence (or independent clause). 
A '''subordinate clause''' also called a '''dependent clause''' is one which cannot stand by itself. The main clause is almost always an independent clause, therefore the main clause by itself makes sense and can stand on its own. However, the subordinating clause does not. For example, ''I love you'' makes perfect sense left on its own. However, ''and always will'', does not. The only time a sentence can be made up of only dependent clauses is when they are joined by Conjunction|correlative conjunctions: conjunction pairs like "either/or", "neither/nor", and "not only/but also".
