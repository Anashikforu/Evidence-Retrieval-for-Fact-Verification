The '''Pleistocene''' stage or epoch was a long period of time. It stretched from 2.6 million years ago to 11,700 years ago.''International Commission on Stratigraphy'' (ICS). 
The Pleistocene was a time of ice ages: cold glacial periods with shorter, warmer, interglacials. Ice ages are when the world becomes much colder for a long time. In much of the 20th century geologists counted four "major" ice ages. Nowadays several more are called "major". During these glaciations, much of the world we know was covered by ice: North America down to and past the Great Lakes; all of northern Russia, and Europe; England down to the Thames.

Many animals that lived then have become extinct. Climate change and hunting by humans were responsible.Martin P.S. and Klein R.G. eds 1984. ''Quaternary extinctions: a prehistoric revolution''. Arizona, Tucson AZ. Many of the mammals were larger cold-adapted versions of animals that live now. Glyptodon was something like a giant armadillo. Mammoths were a species of elephant in the ice age. Their popular name of woolly mammoth suggests the long hair which was an adaptation to the cold. 

Ancient human species lived during the Pleistocene. In Europe and Asia the large-brained Neanderthal (''Homo neanderthalensis'') lived until about 30,000 years ago. Modern man did not descend from Neanderthals, but originated in Africa from another branch of the genus.Klein, Richard G. 2009.
