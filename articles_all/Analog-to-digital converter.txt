An '''analog-to-digital converter''' (abbreviated '''ADC''', '''A/D''' or '''A to D''') is an electronics|electronic integrated circuit that converts a Continuous signal|continuous quantity to a Discrete signal|discrete time digital number. An ADC may also provide an isolated measurement. The reverse operation is performed by a digital-to-analog converter ('''DAC''').

Typically, an ADC is an electronics|electronic device that converts an input analog voltage or Electric current|current to a digital number. The size of the number grows with an increase in the input voltage or current.  However, some non-electronic or only partially electronic devices, such as rotary encoders, can also be considered ADCs.
