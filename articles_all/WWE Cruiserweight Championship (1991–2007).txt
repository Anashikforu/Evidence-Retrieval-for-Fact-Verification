Following the title's introduction in 1991, a tournament was held to determine the first champion. On October 27, Brian Pillman beat Ricky Morton|Richard Morton in the tournament final to win the title. However, it was vacated on September 2, 1992, due to Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Brad Armstrong's knee injury during his reign. Then, on March 20, 1996, Shinjiro Ohtani beat Chris Benoit in another tournament final to win the '''WCW Cruiserweight Championship'''. 

In March 2001, World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. purchased World Championship Wrestling. Following this, the "The Invasion (professional wrestling)|Invasion" angle (professional wrestling)|storyline happened, in which World Championship Wrestling|WCW was "destroyed". During the "Invasion", only four WCW championship titles remained active, including the WCW Cruiserweight title. On July 30, the WCW Cruiserweight Championship and the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship were up for grabs in what was billed as a Championship unification|unification match when the WWF Light Heavyweight Champion, Sean Waltman|X-Pac, beat the WCW Cruiserweight Champion, Peter Gruner|Billy Kidman.

After six months without a champion, on March 3, 2008, WWE removed the championship from the active championship web page, where originally the title was listed as "vacant." Afterward, the title was removed from the active titles list on WWE's title histories web page to the defunct (or retired) championship list. In this way, the title was quietly retired. As a result, Hornswoggle is the last WWE Cruiserweight Champion.
