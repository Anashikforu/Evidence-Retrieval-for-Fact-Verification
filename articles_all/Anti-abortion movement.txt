'''The pro-life movement''', also called the '''anti-abortion movement''', is a group of people who believe that human life begins at conception and that the life of unborn children should be protected. People who believe this are sometimes called "pro-lifers". Pro-lifers believe that life begins at the moment of conception. They oppose abortion. As abortion is an important political topic, they are sometimes called '''anti-choice''' by the ''pro-choice movement''. 

People who are pro-life believe that all humans, including the Pregnancy|unborn, have a right to life|live. They believe that having a human genome is enough for a developing organism to be called a living human being. Others believe that an organism should be identified as a living human being once a heartbeat has been detected. Pro-lifers think that abortion should be illegal. Many pro-lifers think women who are pregnant and do not want to raise a child should look for alternatives to abortion such as adoption.

There are many activism|advocacy groups that try to convince people that abortion is wrong. 

The pro-life movement is most associated with Conservatism|conservative politics. In one Opinion poll|poll in the United States, 66% of conservatives called themselves pro-life. It is also associated with the Catholic Church.
