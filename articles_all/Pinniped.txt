'''Pinnipeds''' From Latin ''pinna'', wing or fin, and ''ped-'', foot. are the '''seals''' and their relatives, a group of semi-aquatic marine mammals. The '''Pinnipedia''' is in the Order (biology)|Order Carnivora. 
There are three seal families: Odobenidae (walruses), Otariidae (eared seals, including sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (true seals). 

Seals are sleek-bodied and barrel-shaped. Their bodies are well Adaptation|adapted to the aquatic habitat where they spend most of their lives. Pinnipeds have flippers for hands, big bulky bodies, doggish faces, and big eyes. Unlike cetaceans, pinnipeds have their noses on their faces, and each nostril of the nose closes when the pinniped goes underwater. Like cetaceans, pinnipeds have a thick layer of Adipose tissue|blubber (fat) just under their skin: this blubber keeps them warm in cold waters and keeps them fed during times when food is not easily found. When they cannot find food, they live off the fat in the blubber.

Pinnipeds are carnivore|carnivorous. This means they eat only meat (such as fish or squid) and not plants. However, almost all pinnipeds can be eaten by Polar bear|polar bears, sharks and killer whale|killer whales.

Seals are often trained in zoos or aquariums to put on shows. However, in Sweden, it is illegal to train a seal to balance a ball on its nose.

 Sleep 
Pinnipeds sleep in the water.Lyamin ''et al'' 2004. Relationship between sleep and eye movement in cetaceans and pinnipeds. ''Archives Italliennes de Biologie'' '''142''': 557 While sleeping in water, the animals go through different stages of sleep. They do some behaviors during sleep: they come to the surface occasionally to breathe, and they now and then open an eye for a period of time. The details vary in different species or groups. Similar adaptations are found in cetaceans like dolphins.
