'''Woodward's wallaroo''' (''Macropus bernardus''), also called the '''black wallaroo''' and '''Bernard's wallaroo''', is the smallest of the wallaroos. The male is black or dark brown and the female is a grey colour. It is a shy nocturnal grazer and does not live in big groups. It uses the rocky cliffs where it lives to shelter and hide from danger.

It is only found in a small, mountainous area in Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, between South Alligator River and Nabarlek, Queensland|Nabarlek. It classified as near threatened, because it is only found in this small area. The name wallaroo means a "rock kangaroo."
