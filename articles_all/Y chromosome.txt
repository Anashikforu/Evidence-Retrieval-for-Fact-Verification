The '''Y chromosome''' is a chromosome that decides the sex in most mammals, including humans. It contains the gene ''SRY'', which triggers testicle|testis development, so making an animal male or female.

Normal females have two X chromosomes, and normal males have one X and one Y. An Ovum|egg always carries a single X, while sperms carry either an X or a Y. That is how sex is determined in humans.Bainbridge, David A. 2003. ''The X in sex: how the X chromosome controls our lives''. Harvard.
