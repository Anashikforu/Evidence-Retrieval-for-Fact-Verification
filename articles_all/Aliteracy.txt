The problem of '''aliteracy''' is the state of being able to read but being uninterested in doing so. Teachers and school librarians are trying to deal with this problem.

Fortune magazine article
Stratford P. Sherman wrote, in a November 18, 1991 
Sherman said that Motorola was making preparations to pay $5,000,000 to teach workers reading and other basic skills, and that, since 1982, Ford Motor Company had already sent 32,000 workers on a similar program. He said that Simon & Schuster  predicted a market of $500,000,000 per year in the sales of remedial programs to corporations.  He quoted a spokesman for the National Association of Broadcasters as saying that "the biggest predictor of scholastic success is the time parents spend reading to their children."  However, Sherman said that the amount of time thus spent meant that the outlook was "not bright".
