The '''Pantanal''' is the world's largest wetland or swamp.

It covers a region of 140,000&nbsp;km2, larger than the area covered by the country Greece.

The Pantanal is in South America and shared by Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay.

There are many threats to the Pantanal such as pollution, Mercury (element)|mercury from gold mining and ranching. Although the Pantanal can wash some of the chemicals away, the increased amount is becoming a concern.

Wildlife is surprisingly diverse: about 3,500 species of plants, 650 species of birds, 230 species of fish, 80 species of mammals, 50 species of reptiles. In 1996, there were about 10 million crocodiles. Within the Pantanal there are a number of specially protected natural areas, including the Pantanal Nature Reserve, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
In winter nearly 80% of the area is flooded.
