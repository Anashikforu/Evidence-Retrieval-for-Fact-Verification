In music, a '''drone''' is a  note which sounds all the time while a piece of music is played.  Some folk instruments always make a drone when they are played: bagpipes and hurdy gurdy|hurdy gurdies in Europe|European culture, sitar|sitars in India|Indian music, and many other instruments in Asia|Asian and Africa|African music.  Sometimes more than one drone is heard (often two notes which are interval (music)|a fifth apart).

Music with drones has to have simple harmony|harmonies because it is not possible to modulation (music)|modulate to different key (music)|keys.  Other things can make up for this, for example, Scottish bagpipe music has lots of little ornamental notes to make it interesting.

Some Western Composers  liked to use a drone (especially one in fifths) to make it sound like bagpipes or other folk instruments.  Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach, Fran√ßois Couperin and other Baroque music|Baroque composers often called such pieces "Musette" (the French language|French for "bagpipes").  Sometimes they did this in orchestra|orchestral music: Joseph Haydn|Haydn used a drone in the last part of his Symphony No. 104 to accompany a folk tune.
