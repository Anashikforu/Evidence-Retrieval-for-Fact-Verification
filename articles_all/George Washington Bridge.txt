The '''George Washington Bridge''' is a suspension bridge over the Hudson River, that connects part of New York City, New York to Fort Lee, New Jersey. It is 4,750 feet (1,584 meters) long and was designed by Othmar H. Ammann. Building began on October 21, 1927, and it was opened on October 25, 1931, at a cost of $59 million. A second level was added below the main level and opened to traffic on August 29, 1962.
There are also walkways for pedestrians and bicyclists on the north and south sides of the bridge.

The main span of the bridge is .

Ammann chose the site for the bridge because the river was narrower at this point. The banks on either side were high, which meant the bridge could be tall enough for ships to pass underneath, without having to build long rising bridge approaches.
