'''Crows''' form the genus '''''Corvus''''' in the family Corvidae. They are medium to large sized birds, carnivores and scavengers.

The genus includes the crow (carrion crow or hooded crow), the rook, jackdaw, and the large common raven. The genus has 40 or so members on all temperate continents except for South America, and some islands. 

The ''Corvus'' makes up a third of the species in the Corvidae. Crows appear to have evolved in Asia from corvid stock which had evolved in Australia. The collective name for a group of crows is a ''flock'' or, more poetically, a ''murder''.

 Intelligence 
Some crow species not only use tools but also make tools. 

They have a brain size (adjusted for body size) as large as some apes.Of course, the absolute size of the brain is also important. The jackdaw and the European magpie have a ''nidopallium'' about the same relative size as the equivalent neocortex in chimpanzees,nidopallium: the region of the avian brain that is used mostly for executive functions and other higher cognitive tasks. and significantly larger than is found in the gibbon.
