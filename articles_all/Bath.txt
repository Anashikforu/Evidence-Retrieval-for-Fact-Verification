A '''bath''' (UK English) or '''bathtub''' (US English) is a basin large enough for people sit in when washing their body.  The bath is usually in the bathroom.  A less common name for a bath is a ''washtub''.

Sometimes people will add scents, oils and salts to the bath for better experience.

A bath is also a place where people can sit in water (or other liquids, often hot) for their health. This is where the town name Bath, Somerset|Bath comes from. Public baths for relaxing were built in all parts of the Roman Empire.
