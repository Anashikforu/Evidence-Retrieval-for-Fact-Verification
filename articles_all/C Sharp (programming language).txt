 Syntax

= "Hello, World!" example =

/ This is a simple program in C#. 
  It simply shows "Hello, World!" on the screen.

using System;
namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Hello
  {
    static void Main()
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
      
      // The piece of code below is optional, but is needed to prevent the program from closing immediately.
