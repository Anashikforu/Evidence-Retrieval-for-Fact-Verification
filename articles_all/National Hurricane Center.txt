The United States|U.S. '''National Hurricane Center''' ('''NHC''') is a department of the National Weather Service, and a component of the National Centers For Environmental Protection. It is responsible for tracking and forecasting the likely behaviour of tropical cyclone|tropical and subtropical cyclones, potential tropical cyclones, and disturbances. The NHC headquarters is in Miami, Florida.

When tropical storm or hurricane conditions are predicted within 48 hours on land, the center issues the proper watches through the news media and NOAA Weather Radio. When those conditions are expected within 36 hours, a warning will be issued. Although it is an organisation of the United States, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has designated the NHC as Regional Specialised Meteorological Center for the North Atlantic and eastern and central Pacific Ocean. In other words, the NHC is the central source of information for all tropical cyclone forecasts and observations happening in these areas, whatever their effect on the US.
