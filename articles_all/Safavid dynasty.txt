 History 
The state was founded by Ismail I in July 1501 in Tabriz, declaring himself Shah.Ismāʿīl I, in Britannica, (2011). Ismail's rule is one of the most vital in Iranian history.  Prior to accession to the throne in 1501, Iran had not existed as a unified country under native Iranian rule since it was conquered by the Arabs eight and a half centuries ago, but was controlled by a number of Arab caliphs, Turkic sultans and Mongol khans. Although many Iranian dynasties came to power during all this time (Tahirids,Frye, R. N.; Fisher, William Bayne; Frye, Richard Nelson; Avery, Peter; Gershevitch, Ilya; Boyle, John Andrew; Yarshater, Ehsan; Jackson, Peter (1975-06-26). ''The Cambridge History of Iran''. Cambridge University Press. . p. 160, "''The memory of the Sāmānids, not only as the last Iranian dynasty in Central Asia, but that dynasty which unified the area under one rule and which saved the legacy of ancient Iran from extinction, lasted long in Central Asia...''" etc.) it was only during the Buyids period that most of Iran returned to Iranian rule (945-1055).Savory, Roger (1998). "ESMĀʿĪL I ṢAFAWĪ". Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. VIII, Fasc. 6. pp. 628–636. Founded by Ismail I, the state was one of the largest Iranian empires and among the most powerful of its time;  present-day Iran, the Republic of Azerbaijan, Armenia and most of Georgia;  He ruled parts of the North Caucasus, Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, as well as present-day Syria, Turkey, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.Helen Chapin Metz.
