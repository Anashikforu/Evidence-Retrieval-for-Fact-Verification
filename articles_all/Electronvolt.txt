The '''electron-volt''' or '''electron volt''', symbol '''eV''', is used to measure energy. It is defined as the amount of energy an electron gains after being accelerated by 1 volt of electricity. Joules are used often for energy measurement, but it is sometimes useful to use electron-volts for very small amounts of energy, such as that carried by a single subatomic particle. To convert joules into electron-volts, divide joules by the charge of an electron, which is about 1.602 coulomb.

E.g. 5 J = 5/1.602 eV.

The electronvolt is often used in atomic physics|atomic, Nuclear physics|nuclear and particle physics. For example, the energy of photons can be measured by the voltage necessary to overcome their photoelectric effect.
