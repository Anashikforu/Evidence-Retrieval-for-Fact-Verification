The family (biology)|family '''Tettigoniidae''', known in American English as '''katydids''' and in British English as '''bush-crickets''', contains more than 6,400 species. It is part of the suborder Ensifera.

They are also known as '''long-horned grasshoppers''', though they are more closely related to Cricket (insect)|crickets than to grasshoppers.
Their antenna (biology)|antennae may be longer than their own body length, those of the grasshoppers are always relatively short.

 Disguise 
Katydids may disguise themselves brilliantly. Some look exactly like dead brown leaf|leaves, complete with holes, lying still on the forest floor of the rainforests of Asia and South America. Others act like green, living leaves fluttering from a branch. They even have vein-like markings like real leaves.
