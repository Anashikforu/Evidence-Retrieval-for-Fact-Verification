'''Hurricane Irene''' was an Atlantic hurricane that formed in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm formed near the Cape Verde Islands on August 4. It moved across the Atlantic Ocean, and it turned northward around Bermuda. The storm lost its name as a tropical cyclone to the southeast of Newfoundland. Irene lasted for 14&nbsp;days as a tropical system. That is the longest time of any storm of the 2005&nbsp;season. 

Irene was a hard storm to forecast. The storm almost died out on August 10, but it gained back its strength. Irene reached Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 2 hurricane strength on August 16. Because the storm stayed far away from land, no tropical cyclone warnings were declared. Also, Irene did not cause any bad damage. The name "Irene" was used again in 2011.
