A '''knock-knock joke''' is a type of joke told in the form of a conversation between a person knocking on a door and the person answering it. It always starts with the phrase "Knock, knock!" followed by the question "Who's there?" and ends with a punch line which usually has a pun or some other kind of word play.

The basic format is as follows:

''Joke-Teller:'' "Knock Knock!"

''Joke-Hearer:'' "Who's there?"

''Teller:'' "a word or phrase"

''Hearer:'' "the word or phrase the Teller said who?"

''Teller:'' "the punch line"

Knock-knock jokes come from "do you know?" jokes in the 1900s and became very popular in the 1930s.

Example

''Joke-Teller:'' "Knock Knock!"

''Joke-Hearer:'' "Who's There?"

''Teller:'' "Police!"

''Hearer:'' "Police Who?"

''Teller:'' "Police let me in; it's raining."
