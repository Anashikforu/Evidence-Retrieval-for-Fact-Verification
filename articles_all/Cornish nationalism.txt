 
The '''Cornish self-government movement''' (sometimes referred to as '''Cornish nationalism''') is a social movement which seeks greater autonomy for the distinctive area of Cornwall. Supporters of Cornish self-government who assert that Cornwall is, or ought to be, a separate legal entity from England do not necessarily mean to advocate full independence from the United Kingdom,
Some supporters of Cornish self-government question the legitimacy of English rule in Cornwall, due to the failure of the former Parliament of England to ever pass an Act of Union, although their claims are not generally recognised within the United Kingdom (or sometimes within Cornwall itself). However, many see some degree of autonomy as a stepping stone towards this, and are supportive of the Cornish Assembly Campaign.
