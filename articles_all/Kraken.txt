'''Kraken''' are legendary sea monsters of gargantuan size, said to have dwelt off the coasts of Norway and Iceland. The sheer size and fearsome appearance attributed to the beasts have made them common ocean-dwelling monsters in various fictional works. 
The legend may actually have originated from sightings of real giant squid that are variously estimated to grow to 13–15 m (40–50&nbsp;ft) in length, including the tentacles.
