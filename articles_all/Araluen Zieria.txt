Where they grow
The plants have only been found near the Araluen Creek. They are growing on a steep, rocky, hillside.

Endangered
The plant has been listed as Endangered under the Australian Government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It is also listed by the New South Wales Government, Endangered (Schedule 1, Part 1) on the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. It is endangered because there are so few of the plants and they are only found in one place. A bushfire could destroy all the plants. There is also a danger from wild goats in the area. The goats do not eat the Zieria, but they could walk on the new seedlings and crush them. The goats might eat all the other plants which could lead to erosion and the soil could be washed away. Weeds growing around the plants might also stop new Zierias from growing.

Saving the plant
There is now a plan to protect the plant. These plans include:
 A fence to keep out wild goats
 Stopping any building or disturbing the site
 Studying the plant
 Trying to grow new plants in other places
 Looking for the plants in other places.
