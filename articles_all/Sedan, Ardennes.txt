History

Until 1651, the Principality of Sedan belonged to the La Tour d'Auvergne family.  It was independent.  The most famous member of the family, Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Marshal Turenne, was born at Sedan on 11 September 1611.  With help from the Holy Roman Empire, Sedan defeated France at the Battle of La Marfée. wikt:immediate|Immediately after that it was surrounded, and its prince, Frédéric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne, duc de Bouillon|Frederic, surrendered to France.  Only a year after that, it became part of France in return for sparing Frederic's life after he was in a plot against France.

During the Franco-Prussian War, on 2 September 1870 the French emperor Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III was taken prisoner with 100,000 of his soldiers at the Battle of Sedan.

Because of this major victory, which also made the "Second Reich" of Germany possible, 2 September was declared "Sedan Day" (''Sedantag'') and a national German holiday in 1871. It remained a holiday until 1919.

In World War II the German army invaded neutral Belgium and crossed the Meuse River in Sedan.  This allowed them to get past the French fortification system, called the Maginot Line.
