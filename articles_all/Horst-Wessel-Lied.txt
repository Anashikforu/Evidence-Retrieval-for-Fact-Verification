The '''''Horst-Wessel-Lied''''' ("Horst Wessel Song"), also known as ''Die Fahne hoch'' ("The flag on high", from its opening line), was the anthem of the Nazi Party from 1930 to 1945. From 1933 to 1945 it was also part of Nazi Germany|Germany's national anthem.
History
The lyrics of the song were composed in 1929 by Horst Wessel, a Nazi activist and local commander of the Nazi militia, the Sturmabteilung|SA, in the Berlin district of Friedrichshain. Wessel was assassinated by a Communism|Communist activist in January 1930, and the propaganda apparatus of Berlin Gauleiter Dr Joseph Goebbels made him the leading martyr of the Nazi Movement. The song became the official Song of Consecration (''Weihelied'') for the Nazi Party, and was much used at party functions and sung by the SA during street parades.

When the Nazis came to power in 1933, the ''Horst-Wessel-Lied'' was recognised as a national symbol by a law issued on May 19, 1933. Nazi Germany thus had a double anthem, consisting of the first verse of the ''Deutschlandlied'' followed by the ''Horst Wessel-Lied''. A regulation attached to a printed version of the ''Horst Wessel-Lied'' in 1934 required the right arm to be raised in a "Hitler salute" when the first and fourth verses were sung.


With the fall of the Nazi regime in 1945, the ''Horst-Wessel-Lied'' was banned, and both the lyrics and the tune remain illegal in Germany and Austria to this day except for educational and scholarly uses (under sections 86 and 86a of the ''Strafgesetzbuch'').
