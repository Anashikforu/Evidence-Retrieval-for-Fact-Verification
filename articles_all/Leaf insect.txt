The family '''Phylliidae''' (often misspelt 'Phyllidae') includes the Extant taxon|living true '''leaf insects''' or '''walking leaves''', which include some of the most remarkable leaf mimicry|mimics in the entire animal kingdom. They occur from South Asia through Southeast Asia to Australia. There are different views about their taxonomy.

 Characteristics 
Leaf insects use camouflage to take on the appearance of a leaf. They do this so accurately that predators often cannot distinguish them from real leaves. In some species the edge of the leaf insect's body even has the appearance of bite marks. To further confuse predators, when the leaf insect walks, it rocks back and forth, to mimic a real leaf being blown by the wind.Cott, Hugh B. 1940. ''Adaptive colouration in animals''. Methuen, London, p329.

They and stick insects go together in the Order Phasmatodea.

The scholar Antonio Pigafetta may have been the first to document the creature.  Sailing with Ferdinand Magellan's circumnavigational expedition, he studied and chronicled the fauna on the island of Cimbonbon as the fleet hauled ashore for repairs.
