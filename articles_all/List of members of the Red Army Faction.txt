This is a list of '''Members of the Red Army Faction'''. After Andreas Baader escaped from prison|jail in 1970, the media began referring to the "Baader-Meinhoff Gang". When Baader and Ulrike Meinhof|Meinhof were arrested, they became known as the Red Army Faction.

 First generation 
These are the earliest members, from the late 1960s. The most important had all been arrested by 1972.



Second generation Red Army Faction
Other young terrorists available to swell the shrinking ranks of the Gang. Like the first generation they were mostly middle class and a lot of them were students. A lot of them were terrorists who joined the Gang after their own groups dissolved (e.g. the Socialist Patients' Collective (SPK), J2M).



Third Generation Red Army Faction
This generation was active mostly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. More vicious than their predecessors, they did not have as much cause as the earlier generations to rebel.
