'''''Lepisma saccharina''''' (commonly called the '''fishmoth''', '''urban silverfish''' or just the '''silverfish''') is a small, wingless insect. Typically it is between half an inch and one inch (12â€“25&nbsp;millimetre|mm). Its common name comes from the animal's silvery blue color, combined with the fish-like appearance of its movements. The scientific name indicates the silverfish's diet of carbohydrates such as sugar or starches. It belongs to the Basal (phylogenetics)|basal insect Order (biology)|order Thysanura, and the species is estimated to have existed for over 300 million years, originating in the Paleozoic Era.
An eyeless species of silverfish, or a close relative, was discovered in January 2006 in caves in Sequoia National Park, California.
