The '''bee hummingbird''' or '''zunzuncito''' (''Mellisuga helenae'') is a species of hummingbird. It lives in Cuba's Isla de la Juventud. 

A newly hatched bee hummingbird chick may weigh about a fingernail clipping.   Its weight is less than a tenth of an ounce (2 g). Because of this, it is the smallest living bird as well as the smallest theropod dinosaur on record.
