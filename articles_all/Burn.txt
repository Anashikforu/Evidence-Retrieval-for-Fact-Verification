A '''burn''' is an injury to a person's skin or even flesh. Heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation can be the cause of a burn. Among women in some areas, risk is related to use of open cooking fires or unsafe stoves. Among men, risk is related to the work environments. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people.

Burns can be very serious injuries, and in some cases can even cause death. Depending on how deep the burn goes and amount of skin affected, a burn can be a medical emergency. For children, at least five percent of the skin needs to be affected.  Adults can tolerate up to ten percent of affected skin.

Burns of a certain extent affect the body as a whole: Common reactions are Shock (circulatory)|circulatory shock, systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis.

 History 

Cave paintings from more than 3,500&nbsp;years ago document burns and their management. The earliest Ancient Egypt|Egyptian records on treating burns describes dressings prepared with milk from mothers of baby boys. The 1500&nbsp;BCE Edwin Smith Papyrus describes treatments using honey and the salve of resin. Many other treatments have been used over the ages, including the use of tea leaves by the Chinese documented to 600 BCE, pig fat and vinegar by Hippocrates documented to 400&nbsp;BCE, and wine and myrrh by Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus documented to 100&nbsp;CE. French barber-surgeon Ambroise Par√© was the first to describe different degrees of burns in the 1500s.

The first hospital to treat burns opened in 1843 in London, England and the development of modern burn care began in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
