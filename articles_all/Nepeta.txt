'''''Nepeta''''' is a genus of about 250 species of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. 

Some members of this group are known as '''catnip''' or catmint because of their effect on house cats. The oil in the leaves of some ''Nepeta'' species gives cats euphoria, that is, it makes them feel good. They get a "high", roll around, and may cry out, jump and behave in an unusual way.
