Name

Her name in French would be translated as Marie "Jeanne Baptiste de Savoie" whereas in Italian it would translate as "Maria Giovanna Battista di Savoia". The addition of Nemours to either is '''incorrect''' and holds no relevance to her other than she was a daughter of a duke of Nemours. The French version of her name is used more than its Italian variant. Therefore she is known as simply '''Marie Jeanne of Savoy'''. 


Issue
