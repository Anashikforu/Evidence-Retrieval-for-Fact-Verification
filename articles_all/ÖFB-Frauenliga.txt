Women football was played in Austria actually before the Second World War. In 1936 the first championship was organized by the ''Österreichische Damenfußball-Union'' (Austrian Ladies Soccer Union) with 9 teams from the Vienna area. But after the occupation of Austria by Nazi Germany it was suppressed. This continued till the end of the 1960s. In 1968 USC Landhaus Wien was one of the first women soccer clubs in Autria. In 1972 the first women championship after the war was  organized by the Vienna Football Union. 1980 the first pure women soccer club (Union Kleinmünchen from Upper Austria) was founded. In 1982 the ÖFB organized the championship for the first time. Actually 334 teams are playing in 5 divisions. Also the number of players increased from 7 000 (2008) to around 17 000. Planet Pure, a cleaning supplies manufacturer from Vorarlberg, is the first official sponsor of the league.
