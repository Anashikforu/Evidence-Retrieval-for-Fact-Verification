# The Land - most of Nishinomiya is on the flat plain in the south, however there are mountains in the north. The town has expanded up the mountains, so many houses are built on the slopes of these mountains with excellent views over the city below and even out over Osaka Bay.

In the bay, artificial islands have been made on which industries, residential areas and a marina have been built. There is a small beach.
