'''''Megalania''''' (''Varanus prisca'') was a giant monitor lizard that lived in southern Australia. It was part of a species of Australian megafauna|megafauna that lived during the Pleistocene, and appears to have disappeared around 40,000 years ago. The first Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal settlers of Australia may have encountered living ''Megalania''.

''Megalania'' is the Terrestrial animal|land-based lizard known to have existed. Judging from its size, ''Megalania'' would have fed mostly upon medium- to large-sized animals, including any of the giant marsupials like ''Diprotodon'' .

Size


Ralph Molnar in 2004 determined a range of possible sizes for ''Megalania''. He did this by scaling up from dorsal vertebrae, after he determined a relationship between dorsal vertebrae length and total body length. If it had a long thin tail like the Lace monitor (''Varanus varius''), then it would have reached a length of  as the maximum.

This is twice the length of their closest living relative, the Komodo dragon of eastern Indonesia.
