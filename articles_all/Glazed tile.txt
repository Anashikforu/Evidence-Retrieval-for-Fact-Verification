A '''glazed tile''' is a tile with glaze. It is made by putting chemical glazes on the tile, let it dry, and putting it into a kiln (an oven that heats up to high temperatures). The kiln heats to about 2000 degrees turning the chemical glaze to colors. It is often framed and sold. This is a popular form of art.

Glazed tiles can also come in a range of textures, from more coarse matte tiles which are good for flooring since they provide traction to high gloss, very smooth tiles which work well for countertops and splashbacks.

Glazed tiles were used to make the roof  on buildings in China.
