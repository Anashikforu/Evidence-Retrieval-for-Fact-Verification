'''''Torosaurus''''' (meaning "pierced lizard") was a large, quadrupedal, plant-eating Ceratopsian dinosaur with three horns on its large head. ''Torosaurus'' hatched from eggs and may have lived in herds.

''Torosaurus'' lived during the Upper Cretaceous, about 70&ndash;65 million years ago, in what is now western North America. It was similar to ''Triceratops''. Some had thought that ''Triceratops'' was a younger form of ''Torosaurus''.Scannella J. and Horner J.R. 2010. "''Torosaurus'' Marsh, 1891, is ''Triceratops'' Marsh, 1889 (Ceratopsidae: Chasmosaurinae): synonymy through ontogeny ." ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'', '''30'''(4): 1157 - 1168. ". Nov 2011. Accessed 20 Nov 2012.

However, latest thinking is that the two are definitely different genera.Bowdler, Neil 2012. BBC News Science & Environment. ''Triceratops and Torosaurus dinosaurs 'two species, not one''' #A lack of good transitional forms, 
#The apparent existence of authentic ''Torosaurus'' subadults, different skull proportions independent of maturation 
#The hole formation at an adult stage is not part of a normal ceratopsian growth sequence.
