She was active during her life, lived on her own until she was almost 110, and talked a lot until months before her death.

Calment still rode her bike at the age of 100 in 1975. Once, she fell off and developed a brief period of amnesia. She recovered sometime later. In 1888, when she was 13, Calment met Vincent van Gogh while he visited her uncle's shop to buy canvas. 

During her later years in the 1990s, she deafness|could not hear very well. In 1995 at the age of 120 years, she became the subject of her own documentary, ''120 Years with Jeanne Calment''. She died in Arles.

Controversy
A study by Russian researcher Nikolay Zak has disputed Jeanne Calment's claimed age with a hypothesis that Jeanne's daughter Yvonne, born 1898 and claimed to have died of pneumonia in 1934, usurped Jeanne's identity upon Jeanne's death in 1934. In that scenario, Jeanne Calment would have died already in 1934 and Yvonne Calment in 1997, claiming to be her mother and aged 122 but in fact she was aged 99. However, to prove if the hypothesis is true, a DNA/blood test is required.
The oldest undisputed person in history is American woman Sarah Knauss, who lived to age 119 years, 97 days.
