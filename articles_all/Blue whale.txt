The '''blue whale''' (''Balaenoptera musculus'') is a marine mammal of the suborder of baleen whales (called Mysticeti). They grow to be about 30 meters long. The biggest blue whale found was 190 tons and measured 98 feet long. Larger specimens have been measured at 110 feet, but never weighed. This makes blue whales the largest animals ever to be on Earth, even bigger than the largest dinosaurs. 

The blue whale eats mostly very tiny creatures, like krill. These inch-long, shrimp-like crustacean swim in swarms. In the Antarctic summer, there are so many of these krill that they turn the waters Orange (color)|orange. A blue whale can eat eight to ten tons of krill every day.Piper, Ross 2007.

The blue whale's body is long and slender. It can be various shades of bluish-grey above and somewhat lighter underneath.

Blue whales were once abundant around the world. In the nineteenth century, they were hunted almost to extinction by whaling|whalers. They were finally protected by the international community in 1966. A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales worldwide, located in at least five groups. More recent research into the Pygmy subspecies suggests this may be an underestimate. Before whaling, the largest population was in the Antarctic, numbering approximately 239,000 (range 202,000 to 311,000).
