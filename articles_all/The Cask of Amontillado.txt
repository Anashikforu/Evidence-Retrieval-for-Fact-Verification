During a masquerade (ball where people wear masks) in the city. Fortunato is dressed in a jester's costume. Montresor tells Fortunato he has bought a wine called amontillado. He wants Fortunato to test it to be sure it is real. Montresor leads Fortunato into his underground  catacombs/wine cellar to test the wine. When there, Montressor chains Fortunato  and then walls him up alive in a niche. 

Fortunato cries out "For the love of God, Montresor!" to which Montresor replies, "Yes, for the love of God!" He twice calls out for a reply but hears nothing. Before placing the last stone, he drops a burning torch through the gap, but hears only the jester's bells ringing. 

The crime took place 50 years before... Montressor express no regrets except for remarking about Fortunato: In pace requiescat! ("May he rest in peace!").
