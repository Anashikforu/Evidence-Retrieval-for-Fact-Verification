'''Ali ibn Abi Talib''' ('''‘Alī ibn Abī Tālib''') ('''''') (Approximately March 17, 599- January 28, 661) was an early Islamic leader. He was the fourth Sunni caliph and the first Shia imam.

Since Ali stated that his body should remain a secret, his followers tied his body on a white camel, and went towards northern Afghanistan.
