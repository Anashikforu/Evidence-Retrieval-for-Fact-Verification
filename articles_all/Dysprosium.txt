'''Dysprosium''' () is a chemical element with the symbol '''Dy''' and atomic number 66. It has a very high melting temperature of 1,407°C. It can also absorb neutrons. This makes it very suitable for use with nuclear reactors and lasers. 

Dysprosium is a rare earth element that has a metallic, bright silver luster.

Dysprosium was first identified in Paris in 1886 by French chemist Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran.
