A '''trapezoid''' (in North America) or '''trapezium''' (in Britain and elsewhere) is a quadrilateral, which is defined as a shape with four sides, which has one set of parallel (geometry)|parallel sides. In North America, the term  "trapezium" is used for what is elsewhere called an irregular quadrilateral.

Calculating area
To calculate the area of a trapezoid, you must add the two parallel sides together, divide that by 2, then times that by its height.

:A = \frac{a + b}{2} \cdot h
