'''''Leedsichthys problematicus''''' ("leeds fish") was a giant fossil fish of the Jurassic period. It was a pachycormid, a group of Extinction|extinct ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii). ''Leedsichthys'' is the largest fish known, with an estimated length of up to 16 meters. The Balaenoptera musculus|blue whale is twice as long, at 30 metres, but that is a mammal, not a fish.

''Leedsichthys'' fossils are incomplete, making it impossible to know the exact length. The fossil is named after its discoverer, Alfred Nicholson Leeds, who discovered it before 1886 near Peterborough, England.Liston J.J. 2004. An overview of the pachycormiform ''Leedsichthys''. In: Arratia G and Tintori A (eds) ''Mesozoic Fishes 3 - Systematics, Paleoenvironments and Biodiversity''. Pfeil, MÃ¼nchen. 379-390 No full fossil is known, mainly because parts of the skeleton were made of cartilage, which does not fossilise.
The front of the snout was made of cartilage.

Food
Like the world's biggest fish today, the whale shark,  ''Leedsichthys'' was a filter feeder, getting its nutrition from plankton. Remains of over 70 individuals have been found.
