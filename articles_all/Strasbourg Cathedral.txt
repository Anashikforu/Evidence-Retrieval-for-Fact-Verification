'''Strasbourg Cathedral''' or the '''Cathedral of Our Lady of Strasbourg''' ( or ''Straßburger Münster''), also known as '''Strasbourg Minster''', is a cathedral. The cathedral was built in Gothic architecture|Gothic style. The belltower is 142 m high. It was the highest building in the world from 1647 to 1874. It is currently the second-highest cathedral in France, after Rouen Cathedral, which is 9m higher, at 151m. In 1880, Cologne Cathedral was finished (157m), and later Ulm minster (at 161m), the highest Cathedral in the World. 

Considerable parts of it are still in Romanesque architecture. Nevertheless, it is widely considered to be among the finest examples of high, or late, Gothic architecture. Erwin von Steinbach is credited for major contributions from 1277 to his death in 1318.

Victor Hugo described it as a "gigantic and delicate marvel"."Prodige du gigantesque et du délicat". Translation from
