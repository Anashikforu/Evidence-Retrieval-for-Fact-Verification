The '''dwarf hamsters''' represent a group of small hamsters in the genus '''''Phodopus'''''. Although they do not belong to this genus, the Chinese hamster is often referred to as a dwarf hamster as well.

Although more limited in colour than the Syrian hamster, dwarf hamsters are an alternative to pet owners who enjoy a smaller, more sociable hamster. The dwarf hamster was discovered by W.C. Campbell in the early 1900's.
