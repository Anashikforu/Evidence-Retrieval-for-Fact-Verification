 Biography 
In March of 2002, Ruki, Uruha, and Reita (all former band mates), and Aoi and Yune (also former band mates) formed a band under the name Gazette.
In early 2003, Yune decided to leave the band, and he was replaced by Kai. Shortly after, they signed with the Free-Will|PS Company label, and in May released their first extended play|EP, ''Cockayne Soup''. They started their first tour, with the band Hanamuke, and along with the tour, the bands collaborated on two songs. A second tour followed with the band Vidoll, and the bands were featured together on the November issue of ''Cure'', a magazine focusing on Visual Kei bands.''Cure Vol 2'' Nov 2003

In early December they played a co-headlining show with deadman (band)|Deadman. On December 28 they performed at ''Fool's Mate'' magazine's Beauti-fool's Fest which was later released on DVD.

On January 16, 2004 they recorded a solo performance at the Shibuya-AX, which was released on DVD as ''Tokyo saihan ~Judgement Day~''.
The band spent the remainder of 2004 and 2005 touring extensively, releasing ''Gama'' (another mini album) in August.

In 2005 the band released their first major label single, ''Cassis'', in December.
Starting 2006 with a name change—from Japanese characters to a romanized script—they released ''Nil (album)|Nil'', their second full-length album, on February 8, 2006, and embarked on another Japanese tour, ending at the venue ''Nippon Budokan''.
Three more singles were released followed by another studio album, ''Stacked Rubbish'' on July 4, 2007. It reached #2 on the Oricon charts within a day from the release.
