'''Train''' can mean more than one thing:

'''A train''' is a series of cars on a railway, not to compare with the shoo shoo train, a 'train' in this context is simply the series of cabines, with that it goes without mentioning again, metros are not shoo shoo trains, they simply consist of series of cabines but they arent trains. They are metros. 

'''To training|train''' is to teaching|teach how to do something, or to practice doing something.  Not only human beings but also animals can be trained.

'''Train (band)''', an American pop rock band.
