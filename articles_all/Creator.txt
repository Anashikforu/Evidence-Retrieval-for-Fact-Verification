A '''creator''' is a person who creates something.

In some religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) God (or Allah meaning '''the God''' in Arabic language|Arabic) is the most important and original creator of the whole universe - including Human|Man who is made "in his image" (see Genesis) to Astronomy|observe it and control it like God. The idea that anything that a person is creating, like an idea, can be ownership|owned as property comes from the ethical traditions and legal codes that came from these religions.

In other traditions (Buddhism, Native American mythology) anyone has this potential for creating, and can become part of the greater creating of the universe. Stewardship of home, Ecological footprint|land and all of Earth is a test for participating in this, or just good sense.
