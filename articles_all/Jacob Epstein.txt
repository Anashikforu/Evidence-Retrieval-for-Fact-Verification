'''Sir Jacob Epstein''' Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE (10 November 1880 – 19 August 1959) was an American-born British sculptor, a pioneer of modern sculpture.
The sculptures ''Ecce Homo'' (Old Coventry Cathedral) and ''Rock Drill'' (1913–1914, Museum of Modern Art, New York City), are famous and important, but we have no images of them. On view in the Strand, London near Trafalgar Square, are his sculptures for Zimbabwe House. There are a number of his busts (sculptures of heads) in the National Portrait Gallery, also near Trafalgar Square.
