The '''Bundeswehr''' (German language|German for "Federal Defence Force"; ) are the German Armed Forces. The German armed forces are for the unified Germany itself and do not have several parts for the States of Germany.

There are five sections: three bigger ones: German Army|Heer (Army), German Navy|Marine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force) form one unified force, not three separate fighting forces. And two smaller ones: ''Joint Support Service'' (Streitkräftebasis) and ''Central Medical Services'' (Zentraler Sanitätsdienst).

In peace-time the commander-in-chief is the Ministry of Defence of Germany|Federal Minister of Defence, and in wartime the Chancellor of Germany. This is unlike most countries where the head of state is commander in chief.

In March 2012, there were about 207,000 soldiers serving in the Bundeswehr; there are another 200,000 in reserve. Conscription for the Bundeswehr has been abolished in July 2011.
