'''Hurricane Dean''' was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. It was also the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma of 2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005. Also, it made the third strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall. Dean moved west-northwest from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lucia Channel and into the Caribbean Sea. It became into a very strong hurricane, reaching Category&nbsp;5 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before moving south of Jamaica on August 20. The storm moved onto land on the Yucat√°n Peninsula on August&nbsp;21 as a Category&nbsp;5 storm. It moved across the peninsula and entered the Bay of Campeche, as a weakened storm, but still a hurricane. It strengthened for a short time before making a second landfall in Veracruz near Tecolutla, Mexico, on August 22. Dean slowly moved to the northwest, weakening into a low pressure area which dissipated over the southwestern United States.

The hurricane's strong winds, waves, rains and storm surge caused over 45&nbsp;deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of United States dollar|US$1.5&nbsp;billion. First impacting the islands of the Lesser Antilles, Dean's path through the Caribbean severely damaged agricultural crops, especially those of Martinique and Jamaica. When it reached  Mexico, Hurricane Dean was a Category&nbsp;5 storm, but it missed large cities and its exceptional Category&nbsp;5 strength landfall caused no deaths and less damage than in the Caribbean islands it passed as a Category&nbsp;2 storm. Because of the damage, the name ''Dean'' was retired, and will not be used again for a tropical cyclone.
