'''Proselyte''', from Greek language|Greek '').

Two kinds of proselyte in Judaism
There are two kinds of proselyte:
# ''Ger tzedek'' (''righteous proselytes'', ''proselytes of righteousness'', ''religious proselyte'', ''devout proselyte'')
# ''Ger toshav'' (''gate proselyte'', ''proselytes of the gate'', ''limited proselyte'', ''half-proselyte'')
A righteous proselyte was a Gentile who had converted to Judaism, was bound to all the doctrines and precepts of the Jewish economy, and was considered a full member of the Jewish people.

A gate proselyte was a "resident alien" who lived in the Land of Israel and followed some of the customs.

Proselytes in early Christianity
The "religious proselytes" spoken of in Early Christian writings were righteous proselytes, as distinguished from gate proselytes.
