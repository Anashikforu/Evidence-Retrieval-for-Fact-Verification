In earthquake engineering, '''vibration control''' is a set of technical means for decreasing seismic loads and improving seismic performance of building|building structures.

 Types of vibration control devices 
All vibration control devices may be classified as ''passive'', ''active'' 
''Base isolators'' restrict penetration of potentially damaging earthquake|seismic waves into a building|building structure while ''dampers'' decrease destructive effect of those waves.
