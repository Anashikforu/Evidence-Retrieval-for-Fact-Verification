'''Callisto''' is a Satellite (natural)|moon of the planet Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter, discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and named after Kallisto.Galilei, G.; 
Callisto has about equal amounts of rock (geology)|rock and ices, with an average density of about 1.83&nbsp;g/cmÂ³. Chemical compounds on the surface include ice|water ice, carbon dioxide, silicates, and organic compound|organics. The Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo spacecraft made investigations of the moon, and revealed that Callisto may have a small silicate Planetary core|core and possibly a subsurface ocean of liquid water more than 100&nbsp;kilometers deep.

The surface of Callisto is heavily cratered and extremely old. The surface does not show any sign of processes occurring below the surface such as plate tectonics, earthquakes or volcanoes, and is thought to have evolved mainly under the influence of meteorite impacts. The absolute ages of the landforms are not known.

Callisto is surrounded by an extremely thin atmosphere made out of carbon dioxide and probably oxygen molecules. There is also a rather intense ionosphere.
