'''Samurai Champloo''' is a Japanese anime television programme|television show. Mugen is a fierce animal-like warrior with a unique Bboying (break-dance) inspired fighting style. Jin has a more traditional style. The two opposing samurai warriors are far from friends, yet their split paths seem to cross anyways. Mugen is wandering aimlessly through the city when he walks upon a teahouse where he meets Jin and Fuu. Fuu convinces them both to come with her in search of a mysterious samurai that smells like sunflowers and their journey begins. This modernized hip-hop tale breaks the barriers of the common, historical, samurai anime.

This anime contains 26 episodes and two seasons, documenting the journey of these three misfits.  The episodes are shown on Adult Swim from time to time, but never consistently.  Whenever on American television, only the first season is aired.
