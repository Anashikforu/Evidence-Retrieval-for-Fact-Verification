 Childhood 
Ryu Gwansun was born on December 16, 1902, in a small farming village. Her brother said that she taught herself how to read Hangul. She was a playful, lively child who enjoyed running "like a boy" and was able to memorize Bible verses quickly. Her nephew, who grew up in the same village as her, said that she had very large, bright black eyes. Her brother described her as tall, with a plump, fair face.

When she was 12, she entered the Ewha Girls' School in Seoul, where she learned more about Christianity.

 Demonstrations 

Ryu Gwansun joined in the March 1st Movement with some friends from her school, though her teacher strongly told them not to. The Japanese police shot at the people, and about 19 people died, including Ryu's parents. Ryu Gwansun was taken to prison. She died on September 28, 1920 from injuries sustained from torture and beatings in prison.
