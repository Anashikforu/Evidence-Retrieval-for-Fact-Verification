The '''storm''' '''history of Hurricane Katrina''' started on August 23, 2005. Hurricane Katrina was a highly destructive Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5 tropical cyclone|hurricane which formed as Tropical cyclone#Classifications|Tropical Depression Twelve near the Bahamas. The next day, the tropical depression strengthened to a Tropical cyclone#Classifications|tropical storm, and was named ''Katrina''. Katrina continued on to make Landfall (meteorology)|landfall on the southern part of the U.S. state of Florida as a Category 1 hurricane.

While passing across Florida, Katrina weakened to a tropical storm. However, the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico allowed it to rapid deepening|rapidly intensify to the sixth strongest Atlantic hurricane in recorded history. Afterwards, Katrina made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana|Buras-Triumph, Louisiana, and once more near the Mississippi/Louisiana border. Katrina did not stop going northward through the central United States and finally Dissipation|dissipated near the Great Lakes, where it was absorbed by a cold front.

Formation
Tropical Depression Twelve formed over the southeastern Bahamas at 5:00 p.m. EDT (2100 Coordinated Universal Time|UTC) on August 23, 2005, some of the tropical depression was from the remains of Tropical Depression Ten (2005)|Tropical Depression Ten, which had dissipated from the effects of a nearby upper troposphere|tropospheric trough (meteorology)|trough. While the normal standards for numbering tropical depressions in the Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic shows that the old name/number is kept when a depression dissipates and regenerates, satellite data indicated that a second tropical wave combined with Tropical Depression Ten north of Puerto Rico to form a new, much more advanced system, which was then named as Tropical Depression Twelve. Simultaneously, the trough in the upper troposphere weakened, causing the wind shear in the area to decrease, also allowing the new tropical depression to develop. In a later re-analysis, it was found that the low-level circulation of TD Ten had completely detached and dissipated, with only the remnant mid-level circulation moving on and merging with the second tropical wave mentioned before. As a result, the criteria for keeping the same name and identity were not met.Knabb, Richard D.; Rhome, Jamie R. "
First landfall
As the atmosphere|atmospheric Condition|conditions surrounding Tropical Depression Twelve were good for Tropical cyclogenesis|tropical development, the system began to strengthen, was upgraded to Tropical Storm status and given the name ''Katrina'' on the morning of August 24. A burst of convection allowed Katrina to become the fifth hurricane of the 2005 season on August 25, only two hours before it made landfall around 6:30 p.m. North American Eastern Time Zone|EST (2230 UTC) between Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale Beach and Aventura, Florida|Aventura, Florida.

Katrina struck the peninsula at a high speed with 80&nbsp;miles per hour|mph (130&nbsp;kilometres per hour|km/h) winds, and had a well-defined eye (cyclone)|eye on Doppler radar, which managed to stay undisturbed throughout its passage over Florida. The storm weakened over land on August 26 to a tropical storm, but regained its strength as a hurricane at 2:00 a.m. EDT (0600 UTC), about one hour after making landfall in Florida. Parts of the Florida Keys experienced tropical storm force winds throughout August 26, with the Dry Tortugas briefly experiencing hurricane-force winds.

Gulf of Mexico
At first, the National Hurricane Center forecasts predicted that Katrina would begin turning northward after landfall, eventually to make its second landfall on the Florida Panhandle about three to four days later.

Right after the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico, the low wind shear, good upper-level outflow, and the warm sea surface temperatures of the Loop Current|Gulf Loop Current caused Katrina to rapid deepening|intensify rapidly. On August 27, the storm was upgraded to Category 3 strength, The minimum pressure made Katrina, at the time, the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record (Hurricanes Hurricane Rita|Rita and Hurricane Wilma|Wilma would later beat Katrina's record that same year). As the hurricane came closer New Orleans, the Weather Forecast Office in Slidell, Louisiana gave out National Weather Service bulletin for New Orleans region|two strongly-worded warnings of the storm's danger.

By the afternoon of August 28, the storm was large enough that some areas of the Gulf Coast were already experiencing tropical storm-force winds. The center of Katrina was about 180&nbsp;statute miles (290&nbsp;km) from the mouth of the Mississippi River, but tropical storm-force winds extended 230&nbsp;mi (370&nbsp;km) from the center of the storm, and hurricane-force winds extended about 105&nbsp;miles (170&nbsp;km) away.

Overnight on August 29, and into the morning of the next day, Katrina quickly weakened (in terms of maximum sustained winds) as it began to enter another eyewall replacement cycle. The inner eyewall disappered before an outer eyewall had fully formed, which was one of the reasons of its rapid weakening. In 18&nbsp;hours, the hurricane's maximum sustained winds decreased from 170&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h) to 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h). However, storm surges remained high at landfall because large waves greater than 30&nbsp;feet (9.1&nbsp;m) in height were generated beforehand (with a buoy recording a 55&nbsp;ft/16.7&nbsp;m wave at sea), when Katrina was at Categories 4 and 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The waves then combined with the storm surge of the large Category 3 hurricane.

Second and third landfalls

Katrina made its second landfall at 6:10 a.m. CDT on August 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h) near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana|Buras-Triumph, Louisiana. Because Katrina had just weakened from Category 4 strength, and also because of the shape of the coastline, Category 4-force winds are believed to have existed on land while the eye was over water. At landfall, hurricane-force winds were recorded 120&nbsp;miles (190&nbsp;km) from the center, the storm's central pressure was 920&nbsp;mbar (27.17&nbsp;inHg), and its forward speed was 15&nbsp;mph (10&nbsp;km/h). As it made its way up the eastern Louisiana coastline, most communities in Plaquemines, St. Bernard Parish, and Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell in St. Tammany Parish were severely damaged by storm surge and the strong winds of the eyewall, which also swipped over eastern New Orleans, creating $1 billion worth of damage to the city from intense flooding and wind damage.

Original estimates recorded that Katrina had made this landfall as a Category 4 hurricane, with 135&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h) winds; however, as mentioned above, the storm weakened just before landfall to Category 3 intensity. The reasons for this weakening are not completely understood yet; while the eye-wall replacement cycle played a part, slightly increasing wind shear|shear, dropping sea surface temperatures, dry air on the western semicircle of the storm and interaction with the continental landmass also may have played a role in weakening the cyclone. This follows the trend of previous strong cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico: all cyclones with atmospheric pressure|minimum central pressures of 973&nbsp;mbar (28.73&nbsp;inHg) or less have weakened over the 12&nbsp;hours before making Landfall (meteorology)|landfall in the Gulf Coast of the United States.

A few hours later, after weakening slightly, Katrina made its third landfall near the Louisiana-Mississippi border with 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) sustained winds and 928&nbsp;mbar (27.37&nbsp;inHg) pressure, still at Category 3 intensity. Its minimum pressure at its second landfall was 920&nbsp;mbar (27.17&nbsp;inHg), making Katrina the third strongest hurricane on record to make landfall on the United States, behind Hurricane Camille's 909&nbsp;mbar (26.85&nbsp;inHg) reading in 1969, and the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane's 892&nbsp;mbar (26.35&nbsp;inHg) record.

Because the storm was so large, its highly destructive eye-wall winds and the strong northeastern quadrant of the storm pushed record storm surges onshore, smashing all of the Mississippi Gulf Coast, including towns in Mississippi such as Waveland, Mississippi|Waveland, Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis, Pass Christian, Mississippi|Pass Christian, Long Beach, Mississippi|Long Beach, Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport, Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi, Ocean Springs, Mississippi|Ocean Springs, Gautier, Mississippi|Gautier and Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula, and, in Alabama, Bayou La Batre, Alabama|Bayou La Batre. The surges at its peak were at 28&nbsp;feet (8.5&nbsp;m) in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and at 13&nbsp;feet (4.0&nbsp;m) as far away as Mobile, Alabama, which saw its highest storm surge since 1917. Storm surge was particularly high due to the hydrology of the region, the hurricane's extreme size, and the fact that it weakened only shortly before landfall. As Katrina moved inland diagonally over Mississippi, high winds cut a swath of damage that affected almost the entire state.


Dissipation

Katrina stayed at hurricane strength in Mississippi, but it soon weakened. It lost hurricane strength more than 150&nbsp;miles (240&nbsp;km) inland, near Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian, Mississippi. Katrina was then lowered into a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville, Tennessee and broke in half. One half of the storm continued to race northward, affecting the Central United States, and it was last noticeable in the eastern Great Lakes region. On August 31, it was absorbed by a frontal boundary and became a powerful extratropical cyclone|extratropical low, causing 1.97–6.69&nbsp;inches (50–170&nbsp;mm) of rain in 12 hours. It also caused gale-force wind gusts from 31 to 61&nbsp;mph (50 to 98&nbsp;km/h) in southeastern Quebec and northern New Brunswick. In the region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean|Saguenay and Côte-Nord, rain caused breakdowns and failure in roads. The Côte-Nord region was isolated from the rest of Quebec for at least 1 week. However, the other half of Katrina broke off in the eastern part of the Appalachians, which caused a major tornado outbreak in the area from central Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia to central Pennsylvania. The tornadoes were strong, killing two people and creating heavy damage.

At 11:00 p.m. EDT on August 31, the center of the remaining storm that was once Katrina was absorbed by another weather system in southeastern Canada.
