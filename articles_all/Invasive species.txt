An '''invasive species''' is a species which is not native  to the place where it is found. It has moved from its native area, where it grew naturally, into a new area. Often it becomes a nuisance species, because in its new habitat it lacks its old enemies. Normally, as a species Evolution|evolves, so do the things which eat it or parasitism|parasitise it. Free of natural restraints, the invading species outcompetes its new neighbours.

:en:Kudzu|Kudzu, for example, is called "The weed which ate the South" because it went out of control in the southern United States. The introduction of starlings to North America is another example.

Natural events sometimes allow species to invade new places, as in the Great American Interchange.
