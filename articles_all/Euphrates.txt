The '''Euphrates''' is the western of the two rivers that define the borders of Mesopotamia. The other is the Tigris, which joins the Euphrates to form the Shatt-al-Arab and flow into the Persian Gulf. Several dams have been built since the 1970s. As a result, less water flows down the river into the sea.
