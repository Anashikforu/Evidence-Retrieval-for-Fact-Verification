'''Hassium''' is a very radioactive and unstable chemical element. It has the symbol '''Hs''' and it has the atomic number 108. It is a superheavy transuranium element. 

Hassium is a radioactive element that does not exist in nature. It has to be synthetic element|made in a lab.

 History 
Hassium was discovery of the chemical elements|first made in 1984.  and '''Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka-osmium'''. It was made at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany. The element was named from the Latin (language)|Latin name for the German state of Hessen.  Hessen is the state that the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung is in. Before it was named Hassium, scientists could not decide what the name should be and there was an element naming controversy. The temporary IUPAC systematic element name was ''unniloctium'' meaning "one-zero-eight-ium" refering to its atomic number. The symbol with the name was ''Uno''. In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 108 be named ''hahnium''. The name hassium was adopted internationally in 1997. 

 Chemistry 
Isotope 270 of Hassium was found in December 2006.  An international team of scientists led by the Technical University of Munich discovered it. It is a magic number (physics)#Doubly magic|doubly magic isotope and it has a long Half-life (element)|half-life of 22 seconds. Scientists had thought that heavy and stable isotopes should exist.  Some theory|theories said Hassium-270 may be part of an island of stability.
