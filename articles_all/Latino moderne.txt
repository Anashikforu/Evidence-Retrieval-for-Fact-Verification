'''Latino Moderne''' ('''L.M.''') is a language made by David Shark|David Th. Stark in the 1980s. It was first published on the internet in 1996. The language is a revision of the grammar of the IALA's Constructed language|constructed (made-up) language Interlingua, using the first creator's words with little change. Applying the same principles that were used in developing the international vocabulary for Interlingua to developing a grammar, L.M. restores personal endings on its verbs and has gender and number agreement between its nouns and their adjectives and articles. The language also has a more clear system for showing case differences with its pronouns. This lets L.M. have a more free word order than Interlingua. Most of the changes that L.M. makes to Interlingua are suggestions were really offered first by the creators of Interlingua -- for this reason, L.M. should be viewed as the next step for the IALA project, not as something in competition with it. 

It is hoped that the spread and use of Latino Moderne may assist in solving some of the communication problems that exist in the European Union and throughout the modern world. In this respect it shares the same goals as Interlingua, Esperanto, etc.. The developer of the language hopes that L.M. will be received and used as a suggested model language to help promote better international communication and friendship among nations.
