The '''Clone Wars''' was a period in the ''Star Wars'' movies. It was first mentioned in ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'' (1977) and was explored later in several films, books, and television series.

Within the Star Wars franchise, the Clone Wars are a set of battles that took place over three years. They were fought between the Jedi and the Clone Troopers vs. the Sith and the Battle Droids. 

The war began during the events of ''Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones'' (2002) and ended in ''Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'' (2005). From 2008 to 2020, a movie and television series called ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars (movie)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' were released. These focused on the events that occurred in between.

Other less prominent media have explored this period as well, such as ''Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars'' (an animated series from 2003-2005) and comic books focusing on Darth Maul. Several new Star Wars characters were created in this period that have become very popular, such as Ahsoka Tano and Asajj Ventress.
