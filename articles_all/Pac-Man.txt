'''''Pac-Man''''' is an video arcade|arcade video game that was made by Namco and designed by Toru Iwatani. It was released in 1980, and became very popular in the history of games.

In ''Pac-Man'', the player makes a Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man, a yellow disc, move around a maze. The ghosts are Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. The goal is to eat every yellow pellet (circles) while not getting caught by the ghosts/monsters. For extra points, fruits that appear can also be eaten. When Pac-Man eats a Power pellets|big pellet, the ghosts turn blue for a short period of time and can be eaten. The time that the ghosts are blue generally decreases from one stage to the next. Beginning at stage 19, the ghosts do not turn blue at all when a power pellet is eaten. Even though the game has 256 stages, the last level can not be finished due to a problem with the creation of the game. 

The player begins the game with 3 lives, and lose one each time Pac-man collides with a ghost. The game ends when all lives are lost. Pac-man gets an extra life once the player gets 10,000 points.

The game is called '''''Puck-Man''''' in Japan. The game was renamed to ''Pac-Man'' in the United States so that nobody could change the "P" to "F". There were many sequels and remakes based on the game. Hanna-Barbera made a Pac-Man (TV series)|animated TV show airing on American Broadcasting Company|ABC in the early 1970s. The game was also part of ''Namco Museum'' games. There is a ''Namco Museum Remix'' for the Wii.
