A '''space station''' is a Satellite (artificial)|artificial satellite in space that people can live at. All past and current space stations have been in low Earth orbit. Space stations can dock with other spacecraft. This allows transferring cargo and people. At present the International Space Station is the only space station in orbit. The first space station was Salyut 1. Prior stations were the seven ''Salyut'' stations, ''Skylab'', ''Mir'' and the two ''Tiangong'' stations.

Space stations are used to learn about how being in space for a long time effects the human body. They also are a place for science experiments and research.
