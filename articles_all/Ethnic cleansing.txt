'''Ethnic cleansing''' is where ethnic group|ethnic or religion|religious groups are forced to leave an area by another ethnic group.  The goal of an ethnic cleansing is to remove one ethnic group from a certain geographical area.

In an ethnic cleansing, They may forced migration|force people to move; deportation|deport people; wikt:threaten|threaten them until they leave;  and use rape and mass murder.

Ethnic genocide is a form of ethnic cleansing but not all cases of ethnic cleansing are ethnic genocide

Definitions
The United Nations definition|defines ethnic cleansing this way:Hayden, Robert M. (1996).  It is done on purpose, as part of a plan
 It is done by one ethnic or religious group
 That group uses violence and terrorism|terror to force other ethnic or religious groups to leave certain areas
 The goal is to make sure that only the perpetrators' ethnic or religious group lives in those areas

A report by United Nations experts said that ethnic cleansing has been done in many different ways, including:
 Murder
 Torture
 Arresting innocent people and putting them in jail
 Execution|Executing people without a trial
 Rape and sexual assault
 Forcing people to live in ghettoes
 Forced migration and deportation
 Attacking civilians and civilian areas (like homes and schools)
 Destroying property

Experts say that ethnic cleansing is different than genocide.  In a genocide, a group tries to kill every member of a certain group, so that group no longer exists on the earth.  In an ethnic cleansing, the perpetrators are trying to get rid of other groups in specific areas.
International law
There is no official legal definition of ethnic cleansing.Ferdinandusse, Ward (2004). 
Examples of ethnic cleansing

=Jews in ancient and medieval history=

During ancient history|ancient and medieval history, Jewish people were victims of ethnic cleansing in many countries.  For example, around 1290 AD, King Edward I of England ordered all of the Jews in the country to leave.  Hundreds of elderly Jews were executed.  Next, France and some Germany|German states did the same.  Finally, in 1492, Spain ordered its Jews to religious conversion|convert to Roman Catholicism|Catholicism or leave the country.  Any Jew who stayed in the country would be executed without a trial.

Ten years later, in 1502, Spain also forced its Muslims to leave the country.

=The 19th century: Native Americans removal=


In the 19th century, the United States government committed an ethnic cleansing against Native American tribes.  At this time, the United States was growing.  Many people in the country wanted to take over what is now the Southern United States.  However, this land had always belonged to Native American tribes, like the Cherokee|Cherokee Nation.

In the early 1800s, the United States government started a program of removing these tribes from the South.  The government wanted these tribes to move west, outside the United States.  Under Andrew Jackson, the United States Armed Forces|United States military took land away from Creek Indians|Creek and Seminole Indians.

Some tribes signed treaty|treaties and agreed to move.  However, other tribes refused to leave the land that had always been theirs.  In 1829, Andrew Jackson became President of the United States|President.  The next year, he signed the Indian Removal Act.  Jackson used this law to force tribes that were still in the South to leave the United States.Prucha, Francis Paul (1984). ''The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians, Volume I.'' University of Nebraska Press. p. 206. ASIN B002DIAUDE.

The Cherokee Nation refused to leave their homes.  In 1838, President Martin van Buren ordered the military to force them to leave.p.&nbsp;41  Soldiers forced about 15,000 Cherokees and 2,000 of their slaves to leave their land.  Because so many people died, this forced migration is now called the Trail of Tears.
