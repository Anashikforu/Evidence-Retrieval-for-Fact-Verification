The '''Brinell scale''' is a measurement|measure of hardness in materials.  It is measured by making a dent (hole)|dent in the material and seeing how deep the dent goes with a known amount of Force (physics)|force. It is similar to the Mohs' hardness scale, which scratches the material. It is used to test the hardness of metals. Normally, a steel ball is pressed into an object and the dent made is measured.
