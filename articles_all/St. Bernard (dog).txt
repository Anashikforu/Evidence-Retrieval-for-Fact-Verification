The '''St. Bernard''' is a very large breed of dog. It was originally bred as a working dog, to rescue people who were lost in the Swiss Alps. Famously, it was believed that they carried a small barrel of brandy around their neck to revive frozen mountaineers. There is no historical evidence that they did actually carry this brandy, although the monks at the St. Bernard Hospice keep some barrels around for photographs with tourists.

It is a very big dog with a big head. A full grown male can weigh between 260 and 345 lbs. The largest dog ever was a St. Bernard called Benedictine who weighed 357 pounds.
