'''Scottie Maurice Pippen''' (born September 25, 1965
In addition to his chemistry with Michael Jordan, Pippen was known for his defense.  His unusually long wingspan allowed him to clog passing lanes and make chase-down blocks.

Pippen went by '''Scott Pippen''' early in his NBA career.  Later on he earned the nicknames '''Pip''', '''Robin''' (to Michael Jordan's Batman) and later '''Batman''' (Jordan was then called Superman).  Off the court, Pippen developed a reputation for not leaving tips at restaurants, and got the nickname '''No Tippin' Pippen'''.

Pippen's nephew Kavion Pippen currently plays basketball for the Southern Illinois Salukis.
