'''Right-wing politics''' is a kind of politics that supports social or money|economic conservatism. 

Beliefs
Someone who is "right-wing" usually supports tradition and keeping things the way that they already are. The right-wing supports tradition and authority.  The right-wing in some countries, like the United States, often supports social conservatism, liberal conservatism or social liberalism (libertarianism), and a capitalist economy where the government has little influence.  Usually the right-wing thinks of society as similar to a living thing, what is called "organic society".  They believe that society's customs and traditions are a collection of things that we have learned from the past and are useful and should be maintained as much as possible.

Types
People who are very right-wing are called "reactionary", and want to either return to the way things were before, such as neoreaction, or more often start as a reaction against left-wing ideas which are spreading in a country.
