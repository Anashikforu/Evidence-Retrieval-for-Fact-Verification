April Fools' Day
Every April Fools' Day, ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' does an April Fools' Day joke. One of the most famous is when they said that Sonic the Hedgehog|Sonic and Miles "Tails" Prower|Tails can be found in ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' if the player completes a very hard task, and for a long time after that, people thought that they really were in. Sonic later appeared in ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl''.
