The '''Intolerable Acts''' are laws passed by the Parliament of Great Britain in 1774.

The British Parliament passed these laws to punish the Massachusetts colony for the Boston Tea Party.
 One of the laws closed Boston Harbor until the colonists paid for the destroyed tea.  
 The Quartering Act allowed Britain to house troops wherever it wanted.  This one was for all the colonies, not just Massachusetts.
 The Administration of Justice Act allowed the trials of accused royal officials to take place in Great Britain if the Governor decided that the defendant could not get a fair trial in Massachusetts. 
 The Quebec Act gave the Ohio country to Canada.

These laws were so harsh that the colonists called them the Intolerable Acts.

Other colonies offered Massachusetts their support. They sent supplies to Boston. The Committees of Correspondence also called for a meeting of all colonies. This meeting would decide what to do about their problems with Britain, which led to the Continental Congress.
