'''Self-synchronizing code''' is a special kind of line code that is easy to ''synchronize'' (having two computers "stay in time with" each other when "communicating"). Code like this happens in telecommunications.

Information on computers is made from binary bits - 0's and 1's (OFFs and ONs). This means that when a computer is being "communicated to", it must "listen" for bits at the correct speed by staying ''synchronized'', or else there will be a misunderstanding. A computer needs to notice misunderstandings immediately, so that wrong things don't happen.

Confusion can happen when two signals combine or misalign, so it's helpful for different "words" in a code to be ''unique'' from each other.


 Example 

 Imagine a language with the only "letters" being '''0''' and '''1''', and no spaces or other symbols.
 This language only has "words" with exactly two letters.
This means that computers "reading" this language would start "reading" the "sentence" at the first two letters, then the next two letters, and so on.
 Two computers, Alice and Bob, have to say the sentence 1100001100 to each other, and it needs to be understood as .
 Alice says the sentence to Bob correctly.
 Bob's "sentence" gets '''de-synchronized''' on its way to Alice, and the first "letter" gets chopped off. This turns the "sentence" into 100001100.


 Code A: self-synchronizing 

Imagine the language only has the words .
 Alice's sentence 1100001100 is heard by Bob as "11, 00, 00, 11, 00", meaning .
 When Bob's sentence 100001100 is heard by Alice as "10, 00, 01, 10, 0",  Alice knows there's been a misunderstanding at the very beginning, because "10" is not a word in its "language" code.

'''Code B ''is'' self-synchronizing, because its "words" are very different from each other, and ''hard'' to confuse with each other.'''


 Code B: not self-synchronizing 

Imagine the language has the words .
 Alice's sentence 1100001100 is heard by Bob as "11, 00, 00, 11, 00", meaning .
 When Bob's sentence 100001100 is heard by Alice as "10, 00, 01, 10, 0", it doesn't realize there's been a misunderstanding until it hears the third "word" "01". By that time, it's already heard .

'''Code B is ''not'' self-synchronizing, because its "words" are too similar to each other, and ''easy'' to confuse with each other.'''
