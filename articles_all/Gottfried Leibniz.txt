'''Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz''' (also ''Leibnitz'' or ''von Leibniz'')International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA pronunciation: . 1 July 1 (21 June Old calendar|OS) 1646 – 14 November 1716) was a Germany|German intellectual who wrote mostly in French language|French and Latin language|Latin.
He played an important role in both philosophy and mathematics. He invented calculus independently of Isaac Newton|Newton, and his notation for derivatives is the one in general use since then. He also invented the binary numeral system|binary system, foundation of modern computers.
Works
He was taught law and philosophy. He served as secretary to two major German noble houses: one became the House of Hanover|British royal family while he served it. Leibniz played a major role in the European politics and diplomacy of his day.
=Philosophy=
In philosophy, he is most remembered for optimism. He thought our universe is the best possible one God could have made. He was one of the great 17th century rationalism|rationalists. René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza are the other two. His philosophy also both looks back to the scholasticism|Scholastic tradition and anticipates modern logic and analysis.Copleston, Frederick C. 1958. ''The history of philosophy, Vol. IV: Modern philosophy: from Descartes to Leibniz''. London: Burns, Oates & Washbourne.
=Technology=
Leibniz also made contributions to physics and technology, and anticipated ideas which surfaced much later in biology, medicine, geology, probability theory, psychology, and information science. He wrote on politics, law, ethics, theology, history, and philology. Sometimes, he even wrote in verse. His contributions are scattered in journals and in tens of thousands of letters and unpublished manuscripts. There is no complete edition of Leibniz's writings, and a complete account of his accomplishments is not yet possible. Leibniz is sometimes known as the last "universal genius".
Leibniz is perhaps most famous for his involvement in development of calculus independent of Isaac Newton and creation of Leibniz Notation which is the standard form of calculus today.
