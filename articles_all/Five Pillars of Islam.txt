The '''Five Pillars of Islam''' are five basic rules in Islam that all Muslims must follow.

The Five Pillars consist of :
# # Prayer (Salat) - Praying five times a day, kneeling towards Mecca.  There are specific ritualistic movements and prayers that are said.
# Fasting during the month of Ramadan (Sawm) - Islamic Fasting is not eating or drinking beverages when the sun is out, only when the moon is out.
# Charity or alms-giving (zakat) - Each year a Muslim must give money to charity (Usually 2.5% of their savings). If a person does not have much money, they can give services to others instead.
# Hajj - Pilgrimage(journey) to Mecca.Mecca is a desert city in Asia.
