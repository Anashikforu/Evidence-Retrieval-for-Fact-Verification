'''Al-`Askarī''' or the '''`Askariyya Mosque/Shrine''' (Arabic language|Arabic: مرقد الامامين علي الهادي والحسن العسكري; transliterated: ''Marqad al-Imāmayn `Alī l-Hādī wa l-Ħassan al-`Askarī'') is a Shi'a Islam|Shī`a Muslim holy site. It is in the Iraqi city of Samarra. Samara is 60 miles from Baghdad. It is one of the most important Shīite mosques in the world. It was built in 944. Its dome was destroyed in February 2006 (see Al Askari Mosque bombing|al-`Askarī Mosque Bombing).

The remains of the tenth and eleventh Shi'a Imam|Shī`a Imāms, Ali al-Hadi|`Alī l-Hādī and his son Hasan al-Askari|Hassan al-`Askarī, known as "the two ''`Askarī''s" (''al-`Askariyyān''), rest at the shrine. It stands next to a shrine to the Twelfth or "Hidden" Imām, Muhammad al-Mahdi|Muħammad al-Mahdī. The `Askariyya Shrine is also known as the "Tomb or Mausoleum of the Two Imāms", "the Tomb of Imāms `Alī l-Hādī and Hassan al-`Askarī" and ''al-Hadhratu l-`Askariyya''.

Also buried inside the Mosque are the remains of Hakimah Khatun, sister of `Alī l-Hādī, and of Narjis Khatun, mother of Muħammad al-Mahdi.
Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine reported at the time of the 2006 al-Askari mosque bombing that “al-Askari is one of Shi'ite Islam's holiest sites. Only the shrines of Najaf and Karbala are more important. Even Samarra's Sunnis hold al-Askari in high esteem. The expression 'to swear by the shrine' is routinely used by both communities".
History
The Imāms Ali al-Hadi|`Alī l-Hādī (also known as ''an-Naqī'') and Hasan al-Askari|Hassan al-`Askarī lived under house arrest in the part of Samarra that had been Caliph al-Mu'tasim's military camp (''`Askaru l-Mu'tasim''). As a result, they are known as the ''`Askariyyān'' ("Dwellers in the Camp"). They died and were buried in their house on Abī Ahmad Street near the mosque built by Mu'tasim.
The shrine around their tombs was built in 944 by the Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanid governor Nasir ad-Dawlah|Nasīr ad-Dawla. It became a focus for pilgrims. It was developed and rebuilt several times in following centuries,
Nasser-al-Din Shah|Nasir ad-Din Shah Qajar undertook the latest remodelling of the shrine in 1868, with the golden dome added in 1905. Covered in 72,000 gold pieces and surrounded by walls of light blue tiles, the dome was a dominant feature of the Samarra skyline. It was approximately 20&nbsp;metres in diameter by 68&nbsp;metres high.
