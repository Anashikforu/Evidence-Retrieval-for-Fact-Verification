 History 
Palm Island is often called a "tropical paradise" because of its natural beauty, but it has had a sad past since Europeans arrived in Australia.

The community created by this history has had many problems and has often been debated about by political and social writers.  Of major concern is a lack of jobs and housing.  Since it became a Aboriginal reserve, Palm Island has been a symbol of aboriginal hardship and violence.  At the same time it has been at the centre of political campaigning to improve the lives and treatment of Australia's Indigenous peoples as well as seeking people to recognise the bad history which lead to the Palm Island of today.
