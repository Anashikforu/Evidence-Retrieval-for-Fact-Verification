'''''Vibrio''''' is a genus of gram-negative bacteria possessing a curved rod shape, several species of which can cause food poisoning|foodborne infection, usually associated with eating undercooked seafood. Typically found in Seawater|saltwater, ''Vibrio'' are facultative anaerobes that test positive for oxidase and do not form spores. All members of the genus are motile and have polar flagella with sheaths. Recent phylogeny|phylogenies have been constructed based on a suite of genes (multi-locus sequence analysis).

The name ''Vibrio'' derives from Filippo Pacini who isolated microorganisms he called "vibrions" from cholera patients in 1854.
