'''Immunity aware programming''' is a set of computer program|programming techniques used while writing firmware for an embedded system. It is used mainly to overcome random errors that can occur in the Central processing unit|CPU program counter or Processor register|register set, Random access memory|RAM or any other that can cause failure of the "victim" device. Such random errors may be caused by single event upsets, not enough power, or by strong electromagnetic signals transmitter|transmitted by some other "source" device.

Most of these techniques apply to the software in the '''"victim"''' device to make it more Reliability engineering|reliable while few of these techniques apply to software in the '''"source"''' device to make it send out less unwanted noise. For these reasons Immunity aware programming is one kind of:
:# Defensive programming.
:# EMC Aware Programming.
