'''Carbonated water''', also known as '''sparkling water''', '''fizzy water''', '''seltzer''', and '''water with gas''', is plain water into which carbon dioxide gas has been dissolved. Most soft drinks have carbonated water as a base. The process of dissolving carbon dioxide gas is called carbonation. It results in the formation of carbonic acid.

There are special machines that allow to make soda water at home.

The process of carbonation can also occur naturally to produce carbonated mineral water. Beer and wine are carbonated by fermentation.

Carbonated water was discovered by Joseph Pristly in 1767.
