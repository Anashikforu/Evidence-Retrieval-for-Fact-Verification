Later, it changed into being Secretary|secretaries, clerks: servant|public servants, journalists, accountants and lawyers. Today, there are no scribes, but there are still authors and writers.

Egyptian scribes
The Ancient Egyptian scribe was an important job. Ancient Egypt also had its painters and artisans who decorated tombs, buildings, furniture, statues, and other relics with pictures and hieroglyphics. In Ancient Egypt, only males could be scribes. This was so in many civilisations, because most official positions were exclusively male.

The scribes had to be able to write not only the hieroglyphs, but also the hieratic (priestly) script, and they had to know arithmetic. They used a type of paper called papyrus, made from reed (plant)|reeds, and wrote with reed pens and ink.
