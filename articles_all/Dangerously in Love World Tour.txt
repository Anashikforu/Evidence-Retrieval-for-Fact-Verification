The '''Dangerously In Love World Tour''' was singer Beyoncé's first solo concert tour, intended to showcase songs from her debut solo album, ''Dangerously in Love''.

 The show 

The stage was simple and featured a large LED screen in the back that moved up and down throughout the entire show and displayed video images of Beyoncé and her dancers, as well as some images from her music videos and some prerecorded images with special effects. 

The set list included not only ''Dangerously in Love'' material, but also contained a special segment of her show dedicated to her erstwhile group Destiny's Child. This concert also featured songs from Beyoncé's 2003 film ''The Fighting Temptations'' ("Fever" and "Summertime"). A highlight for many fans was her performance of "Dangerously in Love 2".
