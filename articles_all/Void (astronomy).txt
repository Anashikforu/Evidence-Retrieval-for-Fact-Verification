In astronomy, '''voids''' are the empty spaces between filament (astronomy)|filaments. Both filaments and Voids are one of the largest-scale structures in the Universe. There are no or few galaxy|galaxies in voids. Most voids have a diameter of 11 to 150 parsec|Mpc. 
Especially large voids are the empty spaces without many superclusters. 
These voids are sometimes called '''supervoids'''.

A 1994 official counting ("''The structure of the Universe traced by rich clusters of galaxies.''", see References) lists a total of 27 supervoids with a distance of up to 740 Mpc. Some of supervoids chosen from the list are given below.
