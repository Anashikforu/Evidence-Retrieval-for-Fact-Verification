In biology, an '''extant''' group is one which has survived to the present day, and so it is a living group. This distinguishes it from an extinct group.

The term 'extant' can also be used to describe species or higher groups (such as genus|genera or family (biology)|families) which are still in existence (living).Barnes, Robert D. 1982. ''Invertebrate zoology''. Holt-Saunders, Philadelphia PA. pp945–946 

Example: in the group of molluscs known as the cephalopods, there are about 600 extant species and 7500 extinct species.
