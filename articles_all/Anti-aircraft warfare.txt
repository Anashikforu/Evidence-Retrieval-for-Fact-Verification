'''Anti-aircraft warfare''', or '''air defence''', is any way of fighting military aircraft in combat from the ground. Different guns and cannons have been used for this since the first military aircraft were used in World War I. They have become more powerful over the years.  After World War II, Surface to Air Missiles began to be used too.   Today, both are used to fight against aircraft. 

Nicknames for anti-aircraft guns include '''AAA''' or '''triple-A''', an abbreviation for '''''a'''nti-'''a'''ircraft '''a'''rtillery'', and '''flak''' or '''flack''' (from the German language|German '''''Fl'''ug'''a'''bwehr'''k'''anone'', ''aircraft defence cannon''). An '''anti-aircraft missile''' is another name for a '''surface-to-air missile''', also said Surface-to-air_missile|SAM for short.
