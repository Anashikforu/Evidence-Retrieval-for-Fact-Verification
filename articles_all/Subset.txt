In set theory, a '''subset''' is a set which has some (or all) of the elements of another set, called superset, but does not have any elements that the superset does not have. A subset which does not have all the elements of its superset is called a '''proper subset'''. We use the symbol ⊆ to say a set is a subset of another set. We can also use ⊂ if it is a proper subset. The symbols ⊃ ⊇ are opposite - they tell us the second element is a (proper) subset of the first.

For example:
{1, 2, 3} is a proper subset of {-563, 1, 2, 3, 68}.

The interval 0, 1 is a proper subset of the set of real numbers (also the set of positive numbers).
:0, 1 \subset R
:0, 1 \subset R_+
{46,189,1264} is its own subset, and is a proper subset of the set of natural numbers.
:\{ 46,189,1264\} \subseteq \{ 46,189,1264\}
:\{ 46,189,1264\} \subset N
