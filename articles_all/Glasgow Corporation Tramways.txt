'''Glasgow Corporation Tramways''' were formerly one of the largest urban tramway systems in Europe. Over 1000 municipally-owned trams served the city of Glasgow, Scotland. The system closed in 1962 and was the last city tramway in Great Britain (prior to the construction of new systems in the 1990s).
