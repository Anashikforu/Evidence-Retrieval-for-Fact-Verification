'''Beverly Atlee Cleary''' (née '''Bunn'''; April 12, 1916 

Biography

Beverly Cleary was born '''Beverly Atlee Bunn''' in McMinnville, Oregon|McMinnville, Oregon. When she was 6, her family moved to Portland, Oregon|Portland, Oregon,  where she went to grammar and high school. She was slow in learning to read, partly because she did not like the books the school wanted her to read, and partly due to an unkind first grade teacher. It was not until she was in third grade that she found enjoyment from books, when she started reading ''The Dutch Twins'' by Lucy Fitch Perkins. From then on, she visited the library often, though she rarely found the books she most wanted to read — those about children like herself.

In 1934, she moved to Ontario, California|Ontario, California to attend Chaffey College, from which she earned an Associate's Degree|Associate of Arts diploma. She then moved to Berkeley, California|Berkeley to major in English at the University of California, Berkeley|University of California. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts|B.A in English in 1938, she studied at the School of Librarianship at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington|Seattle, where she earned a degree in librarianship in 1939. Her first job was as a librarian in Yakima, Washington|Yakima, Washington, where she met many children who were looking for the same books that she had always hoped to find as a child herself. In response, she wrote her first book, ''Henry Huggins,'' which was published in 1950. ''Beezus and Ramona'', Cleary's first novel to feature the Quimby sisters as the central focus of the story, was published in 1955, although Beatrice "Beezus" Quimby|Beezus and Ramona Geraldine Quimby|Ramona made frequent appearances in the Henry Huggins (series)|Henry Huggins series as supporting characters.

In 1940 she married Clarence T. Cleary and they moved to Oakland, California. The Clearys became parents to a set of twins, Marianne Elisabeth and Malcolm James, in 1955.  Clarence Cleary died in 2004.  Beverly Cleary currently lives in Carmel, California|Carmel, California.

She also wrote two autobiographies, ''A Girl from Yamhill'' and ''My Own Two Feet''.

Cleary celebrated her centenarian|100th birthday on April 12, 2016.

Career

Her books are available in 14 languages in over 20 countries. She has won many awards, including the 1984 Newbery Medal for her book ''Dear Mr. Henshaw'' and the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award in 1975. Cleary received the Library of Congress ''Library of Congress Living Legend|Living Legends'' award in the "Writers and Artists" category in April 2000 for her major contributions to America's cultural heritage.

Honors

The Hollywood location of the Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County library, near where she lived as a child, has created a map on their lobby wall of Henry Huggins' Klickitat Street neighborhood. Statues of her beloved characters Ramona, Henry Huggins, and the Huggins' dog Ribsy can be found in Grant Park in Portland, Oregon.

In 2004, the University of Washington's Information School completed fundraising for a Beverly Cleary Endowed Chair for Children and Youth Services to remember her work and commitment to librarianship.

She has a dorm at University of California, Berkeley, California|Berkeley named after her.
