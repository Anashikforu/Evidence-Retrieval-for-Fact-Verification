'''Melatonin''' is a hormone found in animals, plants, and microbes.

Melatonin is produced in the pineal gland which is outside of the bloodâ€“brain barrier. It acts as a hormone, and is released into the blood.

Melatonin acts on melatonin receptors.

Melatonin supplements for humans can be given. Melatonin is categorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a dietary supplement, not a drug.
