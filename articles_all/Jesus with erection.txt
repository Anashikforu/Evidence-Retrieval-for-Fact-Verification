Context
In 2005 the Denmark|Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published 12 cartoons of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The paper said that this was to add to the debate about criticism of Islam and self-censorship. Danish-Muslims said that they did not like them because Islam teaches that it is wrong for people to make any picture of Muhammad and also because they felt that the pictures showed disrespect to Muhammad. This led to protests in many Islamic countries, some of which became violent  and led to more than 100 deaths.

The students of the University of Oregon said that they made the pictures of Jesus because they want to show how people who are Religion|religious feel when people make pictures that may be offensive to Jesus. They wanted to get Islam|Muslims and Christianity|Christians to talk and understand each other better.
