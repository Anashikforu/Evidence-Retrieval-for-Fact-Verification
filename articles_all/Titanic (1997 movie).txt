 Main cast 


 Production 

The movie scenes of the ship's journey were taken on the ''Akademik Mstislav Keldysh'' in July 1996. Many props were made of foam rubber. The material was used for the safety of the Stuntman|stuntmen.Marsh and Kirkland, pp. 130–142 On November 15, the boarding scenes were recorded. Cameron decided to build his RMS ''Titanic'' on the Ship#Some names for parts of a ship|starboard side. This was because weather data showed north-to-south winds. This caused the funnel smoke to move in one direction.Marsh and Kirkland, pp. 52–54

A full-time etiquette Coaching|coach was hired. He taught the cast on the Mannerism|manners of the upper class during the year 1912. However, several critics noticed that some cast members were not very good. They also noticed the two main stars on the movie were not well trained."Quite a bit of the dialogue is peppered by vulgarities and colloquialisms that seem inappropriate to the period and place, but again seem aimed directly to the sensibilities of young American viewers."  The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. Cameron said, "It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance unsure in them." This was the first scene to be recorded. Cameron said that the "big set" was not yet ready. The crew members had to record something so they decided to do the nude scene first.

An angry crew member put the dissociative |dissociative drug Phencyclidine|PCP into the soup that Cameron and other members ate one night. This caused more than 50 people to be rushed to the hospital. "There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics," said actor Lewis Abernathy. Cameron had vomited before the drug began working. Abernathy was shocked at the way he looked. "One eye was completely red, like the ''The Terminator|Terminator'' eye. A pupil (eye)|pupil, no iris (eye)|iris, beet red. The other eye looked like he'd been sniffing glue since he was four."

Filming was scheduled to last 138 days. However, it grew to 160. Many cast members came down with common cold|colds, flu, or Kidney#Kidney diseases|kidney infections. This happened during the many hours they spent in the cold water. Winslet, who also had these symptoms, decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned "a lot of money". Several other cast members left the movie. Three stuntmen broke their bones. The Screen Actors Guild decided to begin an Detective|investigation. They concluded that there was nothing unsafe going on on the set.

The movie's budget reached US dollar|$200 million. Fox Manager|executives were worrying. They suggested an hour of different scenes to be removed from the three-hour movie. Cameron did not accept this. He told Fox that if they want to remove some scenes out that they would need to fire him. The executives did not want to start over. This would mean they will loose their entire investment.
