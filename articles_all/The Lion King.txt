 Controversies 
= "SEX" =
In one scene of the movie, it looks as if animators had written the word "Sexual intercourse|sex" into some of the frames of animation. However, they wanted to show the letters "SFX" (meaning "special effects"). In ''The Lion King'' DVD-Video|DVD the word has been taken out.

= ''Kimba the White Lion'' =
''Kimba the White Lion'' is an animated television program from the 1960s. It was made in Japan by Osamu Tezuka. Some characters and parts of the story in ''The Lion King'' are similar to ''Kimba the White Lion'' but Disney has said that it was not done on purpose.

= "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" =
In one scene with Timon and Pumbaa, they both sing "The Lion Sleeps Tonight". This has caused problems between Disney and the family of South African Solomon Linda, who composed the song (originally titled "Mbube") in 1939. In July 2004, the family went to court, seeking $1.6 million in Royalty payment|royalties from Disney. In February 2006, Linda's family reached a legal settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had let Disney us the song.

= Hidden racism =
Upon its release, some critics complained that the hyenas in the movie were negative (bad) racial Stereotypes of African Americans|stereotypes of African-American people and Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic people.

= Hamas' propaganda =
In August 2007, the Hamas terrorist group made an animated propaganda movie that made fun of the style of ''The Lion King''. The programme was shown on their television station, ''Al-Aqsa TV''. Hamas was shown as a lion that chased and killed rats that looked like members of the secular Fatah group in Gaza. The programme was shown for a short time but was taken off the air for changes.
