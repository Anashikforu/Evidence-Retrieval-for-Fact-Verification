'''''Pokémon''''' (abbreviated from ) is a Japanese anime television programme|series. It is part of the ''Pokémon'' media franchise which is owned by Nintendo. It has been brought to many other places, including North America, Europe, and Australia. The United States dub was originally made by 4Kids Entertainment; starting in 2006 the dub has been made by Pokémon USA.

Not long after ''Pokémon Red and Blue'' (the first ''Pokémon'' video games outside of Japan) were released, the anime was created. It was first broadcast in Japan in early 1997, and in the United States in late 1998. The anime started what has been called "Pokémania", which meant that after the anime came out, it became very popular among children, and many parents assumed it was a fad and no one would care about it in a couple years. However, it was never cancelled, and it is still running, and continues to maintain a fanbase consisting of people of all ages.

The anime shows the adventures of Ash Ketchum, a 10-year-old Pokémon trainer who has many adventures, meeting many new people and Pokémon.

A number of ''Pokémon'' Movie|films have also been made that relate to the anime. The first one was ''Pokémon: The First Movie'' (released on 1998 in Japan and on 1999 in North America). They are still being made.

There are various bad guys in Pokemon like Team Rocket, Team Plasma, Team Flare, Team Galactic, Team Aqua and Team Magma.
