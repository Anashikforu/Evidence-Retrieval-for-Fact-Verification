'''Punjab''' () is a province in Pakistan. The capital of Punjab is Lahore. Punjab has a population of about 120 million people and an area of 79,284 square mile|mi² or (205,344 square kilometre|km²) in terms of area the province of Punjab is greater in area than Kyrgyzstan but smaller than Belarus.

Etymology
The word ''Punjab'' is a combination of the Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian words ''panj'' (''five'') and ''āb'' (''water''), and thus the (land of) ''five rivers''. The name is also sometimes spelled as ''Panjab'' or ''Panjaab'' or ''Punjaab''. The name ''Punjab'' was given to the region by Turkic Muslim conquerors and popularized during the reign of the Mughal Empire in the 17th century CE.

 History 
Before 1947 both Pakistan and the Republic of India were British Raj|ruled by the British. The Punjab province used to be a part of Punjab (British India)|British Punjab. In 1947 the Muslim majority voted yes, Sikh minority voted yes, Hindu minority voted no to Partition thereon, the British province of Punjab was split between Pakistan and Bharat via the Radcliffe Line and the Ferozpur District and the Pathankot Tehsil|sub-district of Gurdaspur awards were originally meant to go to the Pakistanis, however it was decided on August 18th to allocate them to East Punjab. Today India has a state called Punjab (India)|Punjab since 1966. A bus service was launched in 2006 connecting Lahore in Pakistani Punjab with Amritsar in the Republic of India, through the Wagah international border. This was the first bus service between the two Punjabs for almost 60 years.
Overview
Wagah, named ''Wahga'' in Pakistan, is a village through which the controversial Radcliffe Line, the boundary permanent Demarcation line dividing the Indian Punjab from Pakistani Punjab upon the Partition of India, was drawn.  The village was divided by independence in 1947. Today, the eastern half of the village remains in the Republic of India while the western half is in Pakistan.

It is particularly known for the elaborate Wagah border ceremony that happens at the International border gate before 5PM each day.

Since the 1950s, Punjab industrialized rapidly. New factories were established in Lahore, Multan, Sialkot and Wah. In the 1960s the new city of Islamabad was built near Rawalpindi.

Agriculture continues to be the largest sector of Punjab's economy. The province is the breadbasket of the country as well as home to the largest ethnic group in Pakistan, the Punjabis. Unlike neighbouring India, there was no large-scale redistribution of agricultural land. As a result, most rural areas are dominated by a small set of feudalistic Zamindaror the land-owning families.

In the 1950s there was tension between the eastern and western halves of Pakistan. In order to address the situation, a new formula resulted in the abolition of the province status for Punjab in 1955. It was merged into a single province West Pakistan. In 1972, after Bangladesh#History|East Pakistan seceded and became Bangladesh, Punjab again became a province.

Punjab witnessed major battles between the armies of Indian Army|India and Pakistan Army|Pakistan in the wars of Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 and Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971. Since the 1990s Punjab hosted several key sites of Pakistan's nuclear program such as Kahuta. It also hosts major military bases such as at Sargodha and Rawalpindi. The peace process between India and Pakistan, which began in earnest in 2004, has helped pacify the situation. Trade and people-to-people contacts through the Wagah border are now starting to become common. Indian Sikh pilgrims visit holy sites such as Nankana Sahib.

Starting in the 1980s, large numbers of Punjabis migrated to the Middle East, United Kingdom|Britain, Spain, Canada and the United States for economic opportunities, forming the large Punjabi people|Punjabi diaspora. Business and cultural ties between the United States and Punjab are growing.

About 120 million people live in Punjab, just over half of Pakistan's population of 225 million.

Geography

From west to east, these are: the Indus River|Indus, Jhelum River|Jhelum, Beas River|Beas, Chenab River|Chenab, Ravi River|Ravi and Sutlej. Nearly 60% of Pakistan's population lives in the Punjab. It is the nation's only province that touches every other province; it also surrounds the Islamabad Capital Territory|federal enclave of the national capital city at Islamabad.This geographical position and a large multi-ethnic population strongly influence Punjab's outlook on Government of Pakistan|National affairs and induces in Punjab a keen awareness of the problems of the Pakistan's other important provinces and Territory (country subdivision)|territories. In the acronym ''Punjab region|P-Afghania|A-Kashmir|K-Indus|I-Sindh|S-Balochistan (Pakistan)|T-A-N'', the Pakistan|P is for ''Punjab region|PUNJAB''.

The province is a mainly a fertile region along the river valleys, while sparse deserts can be found near the border with Rajasthan and the Sulaiman Range.
