'''Raphael Lemkin''' (; 24 June 1900 â€“ 28 August 1959) was a lawyer of Poles|Polish-Jewish descent. Before World War II, Lemkin was interested in the Armenian Genocide and campaigned in the League of Nations to ban what he called "barbarity" and "vandalism". He is best known for his work against genocide, a word he coined in 1943 from the root words ''genos'' (Greek language|Greek for family, tribe or race) and ''-cide'' (Latin for killing).

Death
Lemkin died of a heart attack at the public relations office of Milton H. Blow in New York City in 1959, at the age of 59.
