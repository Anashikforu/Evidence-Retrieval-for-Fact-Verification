'''Sasser Pass''' or '''Saser-la''' (el. 5411 m./17,753&nbsp;ft.) is a high mountain pass in Kashmir on the ancient summer caravan route from Ladakh to Yarkand in the Tarim Basin. It leads from the head of the Nubra Valley into the upper Shyok valley, on the way to the even higher, but easier, Karakoram Pass.
