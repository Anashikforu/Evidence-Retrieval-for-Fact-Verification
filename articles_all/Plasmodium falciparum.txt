'''''Plasmodium falciparum''''' is a protozoan parasite, one of the species of ''Plasmodium'' which cause malaria in humans. It is transmitted by the female ''Anopheles'' mosquito. ''P. falciparum'' is the most dangerous of these infections as ''P. falciparum'' (or malignant) malaria has the highest rates of complications and mortality.

There are about 200 species in the genus ''Plasmodium'', divided into 15 sub-genera. The parasites are partners in a complex co-evolution with mosquitos and land vertebrate species.Cox F.E.G. 2010.
