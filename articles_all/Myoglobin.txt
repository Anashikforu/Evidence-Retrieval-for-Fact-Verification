'''Myoglobin''' is a protein that is able to bind oxygen. Myoglobin, which is similar to haemoglobin, is the main oxygen-carrying biological pigment|pigment of muscle tissues. Like haemoglobin, it has a aromatic hydrocarbon|porphyrin ring with an iron atom at its centre. It is in the muscle Tissue (biological)|tissue of most mammals. Pinniped|Seals and other ocean|marine mammals have more myoglobin in their muscles than land animals. 

In humans, increased level of myoglobin in the serum of the blood can be an indication of myocardial infarction. Other factors for a higher level can be damage to the muscles, epilepsy|epileptic seizures, polytrauma. If the value is much too high, this can lead to kidney failure.
