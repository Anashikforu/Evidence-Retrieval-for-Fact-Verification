Margaret stands out as the only Prograde and retrograde motion|prograde non-spherical moon of Uranus. The diagram illustrates the orbital parameters of Margaret, unique  among the non-spherical moons of Uranus, with inclination on the vertical axis and the orbital eccentricity|eccentricity of the orbits represented by the segments extending from the apsis|pericentre to the apsis|apocentre.
<!-- to be extended and referenced Margaret's exceptionally high inclination (~57Â°) is close to the limit of stability.
