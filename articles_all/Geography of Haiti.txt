'''Haiti''' () is a country in the Caribbean. the Dominican Republic occupies the eastern five-eighths (63%) of the island.

The country has a total area of  border with the Dominican Republic.

The limits of the country are the Dominican Republic to the east, the Atlantic Ocean to the north, and the Caribbean Sea to the south and west. The Capital (city)|capital, Port-au-Prince, is a seaport located on the west coast.

Cuba is to the northwest and Jamaica to the southwest of Haiti; the Winward Strait|Passage separates Cuba from Haiti (and Hispaniola), and the Jamaica Channel separates Haiti from Jamaica.

There are two large peninsulas: the Northwestern on the Atlantic Ocean, and the Southern peninsulas on the Caribbean Sea. The Northwestern, or just Northern, Peninsula () was Tiburón Peninsula.

Between those two large peninsulas there is a gulf (a very large Headlands and bays|bay): the Gulf of Gonâve. It is named so after the Gonâve Island that is in the middle of the gulf. It was called also Gulf of Léogane after the city of Léogane, one of the oldest in Haiti.

 Climate 
Haiti has a tropical climate but modified by elevation and the ''Wind|Trade winds'' (winds that come from the northeast, from the Atlantic Ocean, full of water vapour), which blow from the Atlantic all year long. In low lands with mountains to the northeast, the climate is arid (dry) because the trade winds leave their water in those mountains rather than the valleys and plains.

There are two rainy seasons, in spring and fall to the south, and in spring and winter to the north. From June to November (mainly from August to October), Tropical cyclone |tropical storms and hurricanes are frequent and can do much damage in the country.

 Islands 
There are several smaller islands and cays that are part of Haiti. The largest islands are:
# '''Gonâve''' (), in the Gulf of Gonâve; it is part of the Ouest Department. It has an area of 743&nbsp;km².  Its Taíno name was ''Guanabo''.Name ''Guanabo'' as shown in a map made by Andrés Morales in 1508 and published in 1516. '''In''' 
# '''Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga''' (. Its Taíno name was ''Baynei''. It is very famous because many pirates lived here. The island's name comes from the turtle-like shape of the island (in Spanish language|Spanish, turtle is a "''tortuga''").
# '''Île à Vache''', also called '''Île-à-Vaches''', close to the soutwestern coast of Hispaniola. It is part of the Sud Department and has an area of . Its Taíno name was ''Iabaque''.

 Mountains and valleys 
The chains of mountains show a direction northwest-southeast, except in the Southern Peninsula, where they have a direction west-east. The mountains are separated by valleys with the same general direction.

From north to south, the main mountain ranges and valleys are:

 The ''Plaine du Nord'' ("Northern Plain"), along the north coast from Cap-Haïtien to the Dominican Republic, where it is called the ''Cibao'' Valley.
 The ''Massif du Nord'' ("Northern Massif"), which in the Dominican Republic is called ''Cordillera Central''. The highest Haitian mountain of this mountain range is ''Gros Morne'' (1,198 m).
 The ''Plateau Central'' ("Central Plateau") is a large high valley.
 The ''Bombardopolis Plateau'' (640 m), ''Montagnes de Terre Neuve'' (1,100 m, ''Morne Goreille''), ''Montagnes Noires'' (1,700 m, ''Pic Bonhomme''). All this chains form one group of mountains.
 Artibonite Plain and Valley, between those mountains mentioned above and below. It is the valley formed by the river Artibonite and its Haitian Tributary|tributaries.
 ''Chaîne des Matheux'' (''Morne Delpech'', 1,600 m) and the ''Montagnes du Trou d'Eau'' (''Morne Ma Pipe'', 1,510 m) form one group that get together with the previous group of mountains to form, in the Dominican Republic, the ''Sierra de Neiba''.
 The ''Cul-de-Sac'' (Haiti) or ''Hoya de Enriquillo'' (Dominican Republic), is a remarkable valley, with a west-east direction, of low elevation (on average 50 m with some points below sea level) and with the ''Êtang Saumatre'' lake in the eastern end, on the border with the Dominican Republic. Port-au-Prince is on the western end of this valley.
 ''Massif de la Hotte'' (''Pic Macaya'', 2,405 m) and ''Massif de la Selle'' (''Pic'' or ''Morne La Selle'', 2,680 m, the highest Haitian mountain) are in the Southern Peninsula. The ''Massif de la Selle'' is called ''Sierra de Bahoruco'' in the Dominican Republic. The Gonâve Island (''Morne La Pierre'', 776 m) belongs, in Geology|geological terms, to the ''Massif de la Selle''.

 Rivers and lakes 
The river ''Artibonite River|Artibonite'' is the longest river of the island and of Haiti. It is 321&nbsp;km long (68&nbsp;km in the Dominican Republic, 253&nbsp;km in Haiti). Its sources are in the Cordillera Central (Dominican Republic) and flows into the Gulf of Gonâve. Its watershed has an area of 6,399&nbsp;km² in Haiti and 2,614&nbsp;km² in the Dominican Republic.

Another important Haitian river is the ''Trois Rivières'' (Three Rivers). It is 150&nbsp;km long and its sources are in the Massif du Nord and flows into the Atlantic Ocean, near the city of Port-de-Paix|Po//
