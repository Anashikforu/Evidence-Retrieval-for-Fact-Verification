Pakistan is heir to one of the most ancient civilizations in the world along with Iraq and Egypt, which also had ancient indigenous languages before being replaced by their present-day languages. These primary languages have not been used in the domains of power because the rulers of these regions were generally foreigners. But the foreigners, whether the Persians, ancient Greeks, Arabs, Turkic peoples|Turco-Mongols as well as the British, have all enriched the indigenous languages so that their vocabulary is multilingual and varied. As the people of these areas converted to Islam, Arabic language|Arabic and Persian language|Persian words influenced and became part of their identity, and remain so. In a sense, it is their very presence, as well as the Arabic-based scripts of all 75 Pakistani languages, which gave them a cultural unity.
