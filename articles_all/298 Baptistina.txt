'''298 Baptistina''' is a common Asteroid belt|Main belt asteroid. It was found by Auguste Charlois on September 9, 1890 in Nice.

Although it has an orbit similar to the Flora family asteroids, it was found to be an unrelated asteroid.M. Florczak ''et al.'' ''A Visible Spectroscopic Survey of the Flora Clan'', Icarus Vol. 133, p. 233 (1998)

A 2007 US-Czech study decided that 298 Baptistina may be the biggest remnant of a 170&nbsp;km (110 mile) asteroid that was destroyed about 160 million years ago in an impact with a smaller body, making the Baptistina family of asteroids and that the Baptistina event may have created the eventual impact asteroid believed by many to have caused the K/T extinction event about 65 million years ago.Bottke WF, Vokrouhlický D Nesvorný D.
