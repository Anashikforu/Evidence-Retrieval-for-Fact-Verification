'''Dessau''' is a town in Saxony-Anhalt in Germany. The next larger cities are Halle (Saale), about 40 km southwest, Leipzig, about 52 km south and Magdeburg, about 54 km northwest. The city became well known for its college of architecture Bauhaus (''Architecture House'' or ''Building House'' related to the German verb for "build") founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar.
