A '''hunter-gatherer''' society is one who lives from edible plants and animals from the wild, by foraging and hunting. 

The line between hunter-gatherers and other people is often not clear-cut. Nomadic people often practice a mix of hunting, gathering and herding, and others spend some of their time in farming.
