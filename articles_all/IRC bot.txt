'''IRC Bots''' are computer programs. They are used on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) to help control and protect chat rooms. They can do many of the things that a human user can do such as gather Information|data, kick users out of the channel, ban users, or even send stats to other programs and websites.

IRC Bots/Chatroom bots are used in many things now, from sending RuneScape statistics, to keeping track of users who abuse the networks.

Popular IRC bots include Infobot, blootbot, Supybot.
