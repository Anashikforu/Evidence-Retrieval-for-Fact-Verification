'''Nereid''' or '''Neptune&nbsp;II''', is a Satellite (natural)|moon of Neptune (planet)|Neptune.

Nereid was found on 1 May 1949 by Gerard Kuiper, who suggested the name in the report of his discovery.  It is named after the Nereids, sea-nymphs of Greek mythology.

It was the farthest of Neptune's known moons for a long time (Halimede (moon)|Halimede through Neso (moon)|Neso have since taken that honour), and is the third biggest, with a diameter of 340&nbsp;km.  Its orbit averages 5,513,400&nbsp;km in radius, but is very eccentricity|eccentric and varies from 1,353,600 to 9,623,700 kilometres.  For a long time this was the most highly eccentric orbit of any known moon in the solar system, but Bestla (moon)|Bestla, a more recently discovered moon of Saturn (planet)|Saturn has a more eccentric orbit.  The unusual orbit suggests that it may be a captured asteroid or Kuiper belt object, or possibly that it was perturbed during the capture of Neptune's largest moon Triton (moon)|Triton.  Very little else is known of Nereid.

Nereid was too far to be properly imaged by the ''Voyager 2'' space probe|probe when it visited the Neptune system in 1989. Photos sent back show only its very non-Sphere|spherical shape, and no surface features could be seen at the resolution available.
