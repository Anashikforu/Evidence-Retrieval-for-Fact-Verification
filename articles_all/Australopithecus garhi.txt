 Earliest stone tools 
Some primitive shaped stone tool artifacts closely resembling Olduwan technology were discovered with the ''A. garhi'' fossils, dating back roughly 2.5 and 2.6 million years old.  The tools are thought to be older than those found with ''Homo habilis'', which may be a direct ancestor of more modern hominins. 

For a long time anthropologists assumed that only members of early genus ''Homo'' had the ability to produce sophisticated tools. At another site in Bouri, Ethiopia, roughly 3,000 stone artifacts had been found to be about 2.5 million years old in age. ''Australopithecus garhi'' may have been the species responsible for making and using these earliest stone tools.
