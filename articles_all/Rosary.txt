The '''Rosary''' is a Catholic form of prayer using beads.  This is called "saying the Rosary" or "praying the Rosary." A rosary can also be the series of joined beads that a person holds while saying these prayers.

The Church has always recognized the efficacy of this devotion John Paul II said â€œThrough the Rosary the faithful receive abundant grace, as by the hands of the Mother of the Redeemer. 
Prayer is for every person to obtain graces and consolations for oneself or for others, for the diffusion of good actions in the world, for the solution of international conflicts, for conversion and spiritual growth.

 Prayer, in the room of your home or into the church, at any time of the day,  
A person who says a Rosary usually thinks about certain events from the Bible.  Each day has a traditional list of these events, called "Mysteries of the Rosary."
