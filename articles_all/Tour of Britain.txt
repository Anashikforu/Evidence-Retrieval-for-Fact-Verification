The '''Tour of Britain''' is the name of a road bicycle racing|cycle race held in United Kingdom. The race is made up of several parts in which the racers go from place to place across parts of Great Britain. The history of the event dates back to 1951. The Tour of Britain is part of the UCI's European Tour.

The race includes teams from Scotland and Wales, as well as a Great Britain team. In recent years, no England|English team has been entered. Teams from outside the UK compete too, for example in 2007 Team T-Mobile will take part.

The latest version, a professional stage race, was first run in 2004.

History
The Tour of Britain has had different names. This is because many different company|companies or groups of people have provided the money needed to have the event happen (''sponsors'').

the '''''Daily Express'' Tour of Britain''' (1951-1955)
::Scotland|Scot Ian Steel won the 1951 edition, in which Jimmy Savile (later to become a famous DJ and television personality and child molester) also raced. The 1955 edition was organised by the British League of Racing Cyclists.
the '''Milk Race''' (1958-1993)
::This was a two-week amateur event but from about 1983, the event was also opened to professional teams. The Milk Marketing Board also sponsored the '''Scottish Milk Race''', a smaller tour in Scotland.
the '''Kellogg Company|Kellogg's Tour''' (1987-1994)
::Winners included: Malcolm Elliot (1988), Robert Millar (1989), Phil Anderson (1991, 1993), Max Sciandri (1992) and, in its final year, Maurizio Fondriest.

=2004 Tour of Britain=
The first edition of the latest version of the '''Tour of Britain''' took place over five days in early September 2004. It was organised by SweetSpot along with British Cycling. The race was sponsored by the organisers of London's 2012 Olympics bid. It was well-promoted and many well-known teams were a part of the race. Such teams included T-Mobile Team|T-Mobile (Germany) and U.S. Postal Service cycling team|U.S. Postal Service (USA). This was partly due to it being a 2.3 category race on the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) calendar.

The 2004 route ended with a 45 mile (72&nbsp;km) criterium in London, where tens of thousands of people watching saw a long break by Londoner Bradley Wiggins last until the final lap. Enrico Degano of Team Barloworld passed him on the final lap to win that stage of the race. The Colombian Mauricio Ardila, of Chocolade Jacques-Topsport Vlaanderen|Chocolade Jacques, won the Tour overall.
