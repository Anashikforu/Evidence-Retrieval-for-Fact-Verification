'''Tropical Storm Barry''' is a tropical cyclone that grew rapidly. It made landfall (meteorology)|landfall on Florida in early June 2007. It was the second Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic tropical cyclone|named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. Barry formed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved toward the northeast, reaching top wind speeds of 60&nbsp;miles per hour|mph (95&nbsp;km/h). It then weakened and first reached land near Tampa Bay, Florida. Barry quickly weakened after wind shear blew away most of the thunderstorms. Barry moved up the East Coast of the United States and by June 5, it was taken over by an even bigger storm.

Rain from Barry in the Cuban province of Pinar del Río Province|Pinar del Río hurt three people and damaged 55&nbsp;houses. In Florida, Barry caused heavy rain in an area that had been in drought. Flooding and wet roads killed two people in traffic accidents. Rough seas killed one surfing|surfer in Pinellas County, Florida. In Florida and Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia, the rain helped firefighters fight wikt:wildfire|wildfires. Damage from the storm was minor.

Storm History

On May 29, a trough (meteorology)|weather system in the Yucatán Peninsula created a small area of convection|thunderstorms over the Yucatán Channel. More thunderstorms formed near the center, and the system became a Tropical cyclone#Classifications|tropical depression. A tropical depression is a type of storm.

The depression developed an area of squalls (sudden, violent storms with wind and rain). A Hurricane Hunters airplane flew into the area to collect information about the cyclone. Barry moved quickly towards the north. On June 2, it reached its strongest with winds of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h).

After Barry reached its maximum strength, strong wind shear removed much of the thunderstorms from the tropical cyclone. Late on June 5, what was left of the cyclone was taken over by a larger weather system, near the border of the U.S. state of Maine and the Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province of Quebec.

Preparations

When Barry was named as a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center sent out a tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning for the west coast of Florida from Bonita Springs, Florida|Bonita Beach through Keaton Beach. Also, a tropical storm watch was issued from Keaton Beach, northward to St. Marks, Florida|Saint Marks.

After becoming an extratropical cyclone, National Weather Service offices sent out flood watches for parts of: South Carolina, eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and southeastern Maryland.
Flood watches were also sent out for: southeast Pennsylvania, northern Delaware, northern New Jersey, east-central New York, southern New England. 
A wind advisory was sent out for parts of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia.

Barry caused heavy rain in Florida, the most rain being 6.99&nbsp;inches (178&nbsp;mm) at Palm Beach International Airport. Other areas reported over 3&nbsp;inches (75&nbsp;mm) of rain. The rain helped to get rid of drought conditions. It also helped in fighting bad wildfires across the state.

The storm caused stormy seas along the coastline of Florida, with a storm surge of 4.78&nbsp;feet (1.46&nbsp;m) at Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater Beach. The waves caused minor beach erosion. The high surge also caused minor flooding on many roads near Tampa Bay.

Barry caused high winds in Florida, which reached 47&nbsp;mph (76&nbsp;km/h), near the southeastern coastline of the state. In Carrolwood, one person was injured when a tree crashed onto their house.
