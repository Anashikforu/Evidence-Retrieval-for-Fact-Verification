placing them in familiar settings. Adam and Eve live in the Garden of Eden. Children play and dinosaurs roam near Edenâ€™s Rivers. The serpent coils cunningly in the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Majestic murals, great masterpieces brimming with pulsating colors and details, provide a backdrop for many of the settings." - The Creation Museum website
