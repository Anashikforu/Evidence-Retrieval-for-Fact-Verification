It was formed from combined parts of the old provinces of southern ''Burgundy'' and ''Bresse'', uniting lands which have no true Geography|geographical unity.

It was divided in seven districts: Autun, Bourbon-Lancy, Chalon-sur-Saône, Charolles, Louhans, Mâcon and Semur-en-Brionnais. That same year, the name of the district Semur-en-Brionnais was changed to Marcigny.

On 10 September 1926, the ''arrondissement'' of Louhans was eliminated but in 1942 it became again an ''arrondissement'' of the department.
