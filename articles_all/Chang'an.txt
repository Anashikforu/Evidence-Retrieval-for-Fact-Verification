 History 

The imperial city of Chang'an during the Han Dynasty was in northwest of today's Xi'an. During the Tang Dynasty, the area to be known as Chang'an included the area inside the Ming Xi'an fortification, plus some small areas to its east and west, and a major part of its southern suburbs. The Tang Chang'an was 8 times the size of the Ming Xi'an. During this time Chang'an was one of the largest and most populous city|cities in the world. Around 750 A.D. Chang'an was called a "million people's city" in Chinese records, while modern estimates put it at around 800,000–1,000,000 within city walls.(a)Tertius Chandler, ''Four Thousand Years of Urban Growth: An Historical Census'', Lewiston, NY: The Edwin Mellen Press, 1987. . However, Charles Benn (Benn, 46), Patricia Ebrey, Anne Walthall, and James Palais (Ebrey, 93) assert that Chang'an and the surrounding jurisdictions of the suburban countryside (the metropolitan area of Chang'an) had a potential population size of around 2,000,000 people. According to the census in the year 742 recorded in the ''New Book of Tang'', 362,921 families with 1,960,188 persons were counted in Jingzhao Fu (京兆府), the metropolitan area including small cities in the neighborhood. (see ''New Book of Tang'', vol. 41 (Zhi vol. 27) Geography 1.)

In 710, the grid of Japan's capital city at Heijō-kyō was planned to mirror the grid of Chang'an.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2002). "Naniwa" in ''Japan Encyclopedia,'' p. 697.  In 794, the plan of the new capital at Heian-kyō also mirrored the Chang'an design.Nussbaum, "Heian-kyō" in ''Japan Encyclopedia,'' pp. 303-304.
