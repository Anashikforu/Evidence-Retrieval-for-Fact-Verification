The '''impala''' (''Aepyceros melampus'') is a medium-sized African antelope. The name "impala" comes from the Zulu language. Impala belong in the kingdom Animal|Animalia, phylum Chordata and class Mammal|Mammalia. Along with cattle, antelopes, sheep, goats, buffalo and bison, they belong to the family Bovid|Bovidae.

 Description 
The impala is reddish-brown with white hair inside the ears, over each eye and on the chin, upper throat, underparts and buttocks. A narrow black line runs along the middle of the lower back to the tail, and a vertical black stripe appears on the back of each thigh. Impalas have unique brushlike tufts of black hair that cover a scent gland located just above the heel on each hind leg.

The impala can jump more than 10 meters distance and 3 meters high, and can reach running speeds of about 80 to 90&nbsp;km/h, to escape from predators.

Female impala, called ewes, have no horns. But males, the rams, grow curved horns with a notable twisted appearance due to ridges. These horns are black and grow as long as 36 inches.

 Habitat 
Impalas are found at grassland and woodland edges, usually very close by water. In Africa, these animals still live throughout Kenya, Botswana, Angola, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Uganda, Zaire and Tanzania.
