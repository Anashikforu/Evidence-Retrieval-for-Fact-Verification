'''Runs batted in''' or '''RBI''' is a statistic used in baseball and softball to credit a batter when the outcome of his at bat results in a run (baseball)|run being scored, except in certain situations such as when an error (baseball)|error is made on the play.

Major League Baseball Rules
The official rulebook of Major League Baseball states in Rule 10.04:
{{quote|(a) The official scorer shall credit the batter with a run batted in for every run that scores:
:(1) unaided by an error and as part of a play begun by the batter's safe hit (including the batter's home run), sacrifice bunt, sacrifice fly, infield out or fielder's choice, unless Rule 10.04(b) applies;
:(2) by reason of the batter becoming a runner with the bases full (because of a base on balls, an award of first base for being touched by a pitched ball or for interference or obstruction); or
:(3) when, before two are out, an error is made on a play on which a runner from third base ordinarily would score.
(b) The official scorer shall not credit a run batted in
:(1) when the batter grounds into a force double play or a reverse-force double play; or
:(2) when a fielder is charged with an error (baseball)|error because the fielder muffs a throw at first base that would have completed a force double play.
(c) The official scorer's judgment must determine whether a run batted in shall be credited for a run that scores when a fielder holds the ball or throws to a wrong base. Ordinarily, if the runner keeps going, the official scorer should credit a run batted in; if the runner stops and takes off again when the runner notices the misplay, the official scorer should credit the run as scored on a fielder's choice.}}
