Lennon wrote the song taking inspiration from a nineteenth century circus poster for Pablo Fanque's circus which he purchased in an Antiques|antique shop on 31 January 1967 while filming the promotional video for the song "Strawberry Fields Forever" in Kent. (The poster idenitifies the horse as "Zanthus".) Mr. Kite is believed to be William Kite, who worked for Pablo Fanque from 1843 to 1845.
