The '''Gospel of Matthew''' is a book of the Bible. (Its full name is the '''Gospel According to Matthew''', but it is often called the '''Gospel of Matthew''' or just '''Matthew''').  It is one of the four gospels of the New Testament that tell the story of Jesus' life and teachings. 

It is ''not'' thought to have been written by the apostle Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew, who was one of Jesus' Twelve Apostles|twelve apostles (see below). The Gospel of Matthew is called one of the synoptic gospels because it has some of the same stories and language as the Gospel of Mark|Gospels of Mark and Gospel of Luke|Luke.

Matthew wrote the gospel mainly for the Jewish people, to show them that Jesus is really the Messiah. Like the Gospels of Mark and Luke, Matthew tells many stories about Jesus' life. Matthew's gospel also talks about Hebrew Bible|Jewish scripture.

Early Christian tradition attributes the gospel to the apostle Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew. This is now rejected by modern scholars.Burkett, Delbert 2002. ''An introduction to the New Testament and the origins of Christianity''. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 978-0-521-00720-7This view is based on three arguments: (a) the setting reflects the final separation of Church and Synagogue, about 85 AD; (b) it reflects the capture of Jerusalem and destruction of the Temple by the Romans in 70 AD; (c) it uses Mark, usually dated around 70 AD, as a source: see R.T.
