'''Polyvinyl chloride''', also called '''Polychloroethene''' or '''PVC''', is a thermoplastic. It turns soft when heated and hard when cooled. Polyvinyl chloride is made by polymerization of the monomer vinyl chloride (chloroethene) CH2=CHCl. PVC can be made softer and more flexible by adding plasticizers. Phthalates are often used to soften PVC in this way.

Vinyl polymers are the most common type of plastic. "Vinyl" is actually Ethylene, a gas that is used to make those plastics including PVC. In popular usage, "vinyl" is often short for PVC, but there are two other vinyl polymers which are more common. The most common is polyethylene, the second-most common is polypropylene. Another, less used, is polystyrene.

 Uses 

Softened PVC is used in clothing, upholstery, electrical cable Insulator (electricity)|insulation, and other products instead of rubber. In the 1950s PVC became the usual material of phonograph records. Some audiophiles use the word "vinyl" to mean records made of PVC. It is used for electrical insulation of wires and cables, production of sheets, pipes (mainly chlorinated polyvinyl chloride), window frames, films, films for stretch ceilings, artificial leathers, polyvinyl chloride fiber, polyvinyl chloride foam, linoleum, dirt-resistant mats, shoe plastics, furniture edges, etc.
About half of the polyvinyl chloride resin manufactured each year is used to make pipes. PVC pipes are 66% of the newer water pipes in the US.  PVC pipes are 75% of new sewer pipes.
PVC plastics can be recycled.  Their recycling code is "3".
