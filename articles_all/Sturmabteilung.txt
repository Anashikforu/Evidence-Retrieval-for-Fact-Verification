The '''Sturmabteilung''' (; often shortened to '''SA''') was a paramilitary group for the Germany|German Nazi Party. Their leader was Ernst Röhm. The group was important in helping Adolf Hitler gain power in the 1930s. 

In English, they are often called the Stormtroopers or the Brownshirts, while ''Sturmabteilung'' literally translates to "wikt:assault|assault detachment" or "assault section". They wore a brown uniform, similar to the black uniform worn by Mussolini|Mussolini's Blackshirts.

The word ''Sturmabteilung'' was used before the founding of the Nazi Party in 1919.  It originally comes from the specialized assault troops used by Germany in World War I using ''Oskar von Hutier|Hutier'' infiltration tactics.

The SA played a key role in Adolf Hitler's rise to power in the 1930s. In 1934, however, he abolished the organization and sent the Schutzstaffel to arrest and kill their leaders.
