In computing, an '''arithmetic logic unit''' ('''ALU''') is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU is a basic building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer,  even the simplest microcontrollers contain one for purposes such as timing. 

Now, modern microprocessors, microcontrollers and Central processing unit|CPUs have very powerful and very complex ALUs. Also, more recent Central processing unit|CPUs may contain up to more than 4 ALUs (see Superscalar|superscalar CPUs).

Mathematician John von Neumann proposed the ALU concept in 1945.
