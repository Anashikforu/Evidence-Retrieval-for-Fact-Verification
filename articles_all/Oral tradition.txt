An '''oral tradition''' or '''oral culture''' is a way of transmitting history, literature or law from one generation to the next, without a writing system, by voice. People tell stories. Often the stories are made into Poetry|poems and songs to make remembering easy. For example, the Homeric poetry of the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' combined oral literature and oral history. Eventually they were written down.
