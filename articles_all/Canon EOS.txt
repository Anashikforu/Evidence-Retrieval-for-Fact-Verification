The '''Canon (company)|Canon EOS''' ('''Electro-Optical System''') is an autofocus 135 film|35 mm photographic film|film and digital photography|digital single-lens reflex camera|SLR camera system that was introduced in 1987 with the Canon EOS 650 and is still in production as Canon's current Digital single-lens reflex camera|dSLR system.  The acronym EOS was chosen for Eos in Greek mythology, and is often pronounced as a word (i.e., ''EE-oss''), although some spell out the letters, reading it as an initialism. Both pronunciations are acceptable as there is no official pronunciation.

It competes primarily with the Nikon F series and its successors, as well as autofocus SLR systems from Olympus Corporation, Pentax, Sony/Minolta, and Panasonic/Leica. In most countries, EOS cameras have the largest market share of SLR cameras.
