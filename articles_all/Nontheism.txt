''''Nontheism'''' is a term that describes anyone who is not a theist. In other words, a '''nontheist''' is anyone who does not have a specific belief in a god or deity. It usually refers to anyone who does not have any religious belief. This is a lot like atheism, but the two terms are often used in different ways.

 Origin of the term 
The term "''nontheism''" was first used by George Holyoake|G. J. Holyoake in 1852,."The Reasoner", New Series, No. VIII. 115 He used it because of the bad associations with the term '''atheism'''.
:"Mr. Charles Southwell has taken an objection to the term Atheism. We are glad he has. We have disused it a long time .... We disuse it, because Atheist is a worn-out word. Both the ancients and the moderns have understood by it ''one without God, and also without morality''. Thus the term connotes more than any well-informed and earnest person accepting it ever included in it; that is, the word carries with it associations of immorality, which have been repudiated by the Atheist as seriously as by the Christian. Non-theism is a term less open to the same misunderstanding, as it implies the simple non-acceptance of the Theist's explanation of the origin and government of the world."
