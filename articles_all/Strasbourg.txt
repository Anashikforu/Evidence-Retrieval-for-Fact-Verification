The city was founded in 12 BC by Drusus, the brother of Tiberius. Its Celtic name was ''Argentorate'' (which the Ancient Rome|Romans called ''Argentoratum''). People think this name is linked to the river Ill (that flows into the Rhine near Strasbourg).

At that time, it was on the Limes, a fortification the Romans built across Europe (to keep out the Germanic tribes). There was a fortification (named ''castella drusi'', ''drusus fort'') at that spot. Soldiers need to live from something, so a local civilian settlement developed there. Later, the Limes was pushed farther east.

 Climate 
Strasbourg has an oceanic climate (''Cfb'' in the Koeppen climate classification).
