'''B cells''' are lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Once the B cell is activated, it turns into a plasma cell,Plasma cell = cell which makes antibodies and starts producing antibodies. They are a vital part of the adaptive immune system. They have a protein on the B cell's Cell membrane|outer surface known as a 'B cell receptor'. This allows a B cell to bind to a '''specific''' antigen.

The main functions of B cells are:
#to make antibody|antibodies against antigens, 
#to perform the role of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), 
#to develop into memory B cells after activation by antigen interaction.

Recently, a new, suppressive function of B cells has been discovered.

In mammals, immature B cells are formed in the bone marrow, hence their name.Alberts B. ''et al'' 2002.
