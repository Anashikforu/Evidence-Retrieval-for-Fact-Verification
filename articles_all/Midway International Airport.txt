 History 
Originally named '''Chicago Air Park''',

In 1931 a new passenger terminal opened at 62nd St; the following year the airport claimed to be the "World's busiest airport|World's Busiest" with over 100,846 passengers on 60,947 flights. New York's airport (Newark, then LaGuardia by the end of 1939) was then the busiest airline airport in the United States, but Midway passed LaGuardia in 1948 and kept the title until 1960.

More construction was funded in part by $1&nbsp;million from the Works Progress Administration; the airport expanded to fill the square mile in 1938â€“41 after a court ordered the Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad to reroute tracks that had crossed the square along the north edge of the older field.
