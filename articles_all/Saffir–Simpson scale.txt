The '''Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale''' is a scale that is used to wikt:sort|sort tropical cyclones in the Western Hemisphere. It is only used for storms that are stronger than "tropical storms", and become actual hurricanes. The categories into which the scale separates hurricanes are noted by the strength of their maximum sustained wind speeds. The classifications are used mainly to predict the possible wind damage a hurricane will create when it makes landfall. It does not measure rainfall or storm surge or how wide the storm is.

The scale is also used to classify subtropical cyclones after a change in the rules made by the National Hurricane Center in 2002.

The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale is used only to describe hurricanes that form in the Atlantic Ocean and northern Pacific Ocean, to the east of the International Date Line. Other areas call their tropical storms by other names, and use their own classification scales.

Examples
=Category 1=

'''''Dangerous winds will produce some damage'''''

Category&nbsp;1 storms may damage roofs, shingles, vinyl sidings, and gutters to well-constructed frame homes. Large branches of trees will snap and shallowly rooted trees may be toppled. Extensive damage to power lines and poles likely will result in power outages that could last a few to several days.

Hurricanes that peaked at Category&nbsp;1 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include: Hurricane Agnes|Agnes (1972), Hurricane Juan (1985)|Juan (1985), Hurricane Ismael|Ismael (1995), Danny (1997), Claudette (2003), Hurricane Gaston (2004)|Gaston (2004), Hurricane Stan|Stan (2005), Hurricane Humberto (2007)|Humberto (2007), Hurricane Isaac (2012)|Isaac (2012), Hurricane Manuel|Manuel (2013), Hurricane Earl (2016)|Earl (2016),  Hurricane Hermine|Hermine (2016), Hurricane Nate|Nate (2017), Hurricane Barry (2019)|Barry (2019), Lorena (2019), Hurricane Hanna (2020)|Hanna (2020), Hurricane Isaias|Isaias (2020), and Nana (2020).

=Category 2=

'''''Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage'''''

Category&nbsp;2 storms may produce extremely dangerous winds that will cause extensive damage: Well-constructed frame homes could sustain major roof and siding damage. Many shallowly rooted trees will be snapped or uprooted and block numerous roads. Near-total power loss is expected with outages that could last from several days to weeks.

Hurricanes that peaked at Category&nbsp;2 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include: Able (1952), Alice (1954), Ella (1958), Fifi (1974), Hurricane Diana|Diana (1990), Gert (1993), Hurricane Rosa (1994)|Rosa (1994), Hurricane Erin (1995)|Erin (1995), Alma (1996), Hurricane Juan|Juan (2003), Hurricane Alex (2010)|Alex (2010), Hurricane Richard|Richard (2010), Hurricane Tomas|Tomas (2010), Carlotta (2012), Hurricane Ernesto (2012)|Ernesto (2012), Hurricane Arthur|Arthur (2014), Hurricane Sally|Sally (2020), and Hurricane Zeta|Zeta (2020).

=Category 3=

'''''Devastating damage will occur'''''

Tropical cyclones of Category&nbsp;3 and higher are Tropical cyclone#Classifications, terminology, and naming|major hurricanes, and devastating damage will occur: Well-built framed homes may incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends. Many trees will be snapped or uprooted, blocking numerous roads. Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes.

Hurricanes that peaked at Category&nbsp;3 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include: Hurricane Easy (1950)|Easy (1950), Hurricane Carol|Carol (1954), Hilda (1955), Hurricane Audrey|Audrey (1957), Hurricane Celia|Celia (1970), Ella (1970), Caroline (1975), Hurricane Eloise|Eloise (1975), Olivia (1975), Hurricane Alicia|Alicia (1983), Hurricane Elena|Elena (1985), Hurricane Roxanne|Roxanne (1995), Hurricane Fran|Fran (1996), Hurricane Isidore|Isidore (2002), Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne (2004), Hurricane Lane (2006)|Lane (2006), Karl (2010),   and Hurricane Otto|Otto (2016).

=Category 4=

'''''Catastrophic damage will occur'''''

Category&nbsp;4 storms may cause catastrophic damage. Well-built framed homes can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.

The 1900 Galveston hurricane, the deadliest natural disaster (at the time) to hit the United States, peaked at an intensity that corresponds to a modern-day Category&nbsp;4 storm. Other examples of storms that peaked at Category&nbsp;4 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include: Hurricane Donna|Donna (1960), Hurricane Flora|Flora (1963), Hurricane Cleo|Cleo (1964), Hurricane Betsy|Betsy (1965), Hurricane Carmen|Carmen (1974), Hurricane Frederic|Frederic (1979), Joan (1988), Hurricane Iniki|Iniki (1992), Hurricane Luis|Luis (1995), Hurricane Iris|Iris (2001), Hurricane Charley|Charley (2004), Hurricane Dennis|Dennis (2005), Hurricane Gustav|Gustav (2008), Hurricane Ike|Ike (2008), Hurricane Joaquin|Joaquin (2015), Hurricane Harvey|Harvey (2017),  Hurricane Laura|Laura (2020), and Hurricane Eta|Eta (2020).

=Category 5=

'''''Near-total damage will occur'''''

Category&nbsp;5 is the highest category of the Saffir–Simpson scale. These storms cause roofs to break apart on many buildings, and some building may break apart, with small utility buildings blown over or away. Collapse of many roofs and walls, especially those with no inside supports, is common. Very heavy and unfixable damage to many wooden buildings and total destruction to mobile/manufactured homes is common. Only a few types of buildings can survive, and only if located at least  inland. They include office, condominium and apartment buildings and hotels that are of concrete or steel frame construction, multi-story concrete parking garages, and residences that are made of either lots of brick or concrete/cement block and have roofs with slopes of no less than 35&nbsp;degrees from Horizontal|a horizontal angle and no overhangs of any kind, and if the windows are either made of hurricane-resistant safety glass or covered with shutters. Unless most of these requirements are met, the catastrophic destruction of a structure may occur.

The storm's flooding causes major damage to the lower floors of all structures near the shoreline, and many coastal structures can be completely flattened or washed away by the storm surge. Virtually all trees are uprooted or snapped and some may be debarked, isolating most affected communities. Massive evacuation of residential areas may be required if the hurricane threatens populated areas. Total and extremely long-lived power outages and water losses are to be expected, possibly for up to several months.

Historical examples of storms that made landfall at Category&nbsp;5 status include: "Cuba" (1924), 1928 Okeechobee hurricane|"Okeechobee" (1928), "Bahamas" (1932), "Cuba–Brownsville" (1933), "Labor Day" (1935), Hurricane Janet|Janet (1955), Hurricane Camille|Camille (1969), Hurricane Edith (1971)|Edith (1971), Hurricane Anita|Anita (1977), Hurricane David|David (1979), Hurricane Gilbert|Gilbert (1988), Hurricane Andrew|Andrew (1992), Hurricane Dean|Dean (2007), Hurricane Felix|Felix (2007), Hurricane Irma|Irma (2017), Hurricane Maria|Maria (2017),
