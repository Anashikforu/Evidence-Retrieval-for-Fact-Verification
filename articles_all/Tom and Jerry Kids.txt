'''''Tom and Jerry Kids Show''''' is a 1990 television series by Hanna-Barbera Studios. This follows Tom and Jerry as kids in their cat-and-mouse games. The show also contains segments featuring Droopy and his son Dripple (who would later star in their own short-lived spin-off, "Droopy, Master Detective"), Spike & Tyke (from the original ''Tom & Jerry'') and Blast-Off Buzzard (from "The CB Bears"). The original run lasted until 1994 when the show was canceled. In certain countries, the Tom & Jerry Kids shorts have aired separately on Boomerang until 2014.
