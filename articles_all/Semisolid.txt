A '''semisolid''' is a substance that is in between a solid and a liquid. Another name for a semi-solid is a quasi-solid. Mayonnaise is an example of a semi-solid. Mayonnaise does not hold its shape like a solid but does not flow like a liquid. A substance like gel or cream is another example of a semi-solid. Normally semi-solids are covalent bond|covalent things. Covalent substances get softer and softer until they melt. Ionic bond|Ionic substances melt at one temperature and do not get softer. Butter can be a semisolid when it is warm. Butter does not hold its shape but it does not flow like a liquid. Paint is also a semisolid, since it is highly viscous.
