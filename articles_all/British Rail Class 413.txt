The British Rail '''Class 413''' (or British Rail unit designations|4Cap) units were formed in 1982 by permanently coupling two British Rail Class 414|Class 414 British Rail unit designations|2Hap units together. The cabs in the centre of the unit were decommissioned, thus reducing the weight of the units.
