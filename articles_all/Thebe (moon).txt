'''Thebe''' or ''''''.
 Orbit 
Thebe is the farthest of the inner satellites of Jupiter|inner Jovian moons. It orbits Jupiter at a distance of ~222,000 kilometre|km (3.11 Jupiter radius|radii). The orbit of Thebe has an orbital eccentricity of ~0.018 and an inclination of ~1.08° relative to the equator of Jupiter. These values are unusually high for a closer moon and can be explained by the past influence of the closest Galilean satellite Io (moon)|Io; in the past, several orbital resonance|mean motion resonances with Io (moon)|Io would have passed through Thebe's orbit as Io gradually moved away from Jupiter, and these excited Thebe's orbit.

 Physical characteristics 
Thebe is not a sphere, with the closest ellipsoidal approximation being 116x98x84 km. Its bulk density and mass are not known but assuming that it mean density is like that of Amalthea (~0.86 g/cm³) its mass can be estimated at ~4.3×1017 kg.

The surface of Thebe is dark and appears to be reddish in color.

 Exploration 
Thebe was found in ''Voyager 1'' images by Steve Synnott, a member of the Voyager navigation team. However, before the Galileo spacecraft|''Galileo'' spacecraft arrived at Jupiter, little was known about it. ''Galileo'' imaged almost all of the surface of Thebe and put constraints on its composition.
