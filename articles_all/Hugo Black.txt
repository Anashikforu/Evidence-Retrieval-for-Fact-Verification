'''Hugo LaFayette Black''' (February 27, 1886 â€“ September 25, 1971) was an American judge and politician.  He was from Ashland, Alabama and studied law at the University of Alabama.  Black was poor as a child and lived simply for most of his life.  Black was in the Army during World War I.  In the 1920s, Black was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.  Black was the fifth longest-serving justice in American history. He served on the Court for 35 years, one of the very longest tenures, and was the last of president Roosevelt's appointees except William O. Douglas (who served 36 years, the longest).  Black died of a stroke (medicine)|stroke in 1971, which happened two days after he chose to leave the Supreme Court. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

One of the most famous judgments Black wrote is called ''Korematsu v. United States'' in 1944. In this case, the majority believed the imprisoning of civilian (non-military) Japanese Americans during World War II was just or at least acceptable, under the circumstances. This is one of the most controversial verdicts of the Supreme Court in its history and often seen as a stark contrast (meaning opposite) to what he stood for in most other cases.
