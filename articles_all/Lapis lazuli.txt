Lapis lazuli is a metamorphic rock made from several minerals, but mainly Lazurite. 
Lazurite has been mined for over 6,000 years in Afghanistan. It is also mined at Lake Baikal in Siberia; at Mount Vesuvius in Italy; in Burma; Canada; and the United States.Eastaugh, Nicholas ''et al'' 2004.

Afghanistan was the source of lapis for the ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations, as well as the Ancient Greeks and Ancient Rome|Romans. During the height of the Indus Valley civilization about 2000 BC, the Harappan colony now known as Shortugai was established near the lapis mines.Bowersox, Gary W. & Chamberlin, Bonita E. 1999.

In addition to the Afghan deposits, lapis has been extracted for many years in the Andes (near Ovalle, Chile|Ovalle, Chile), the Lake Baikal region of Russia; Siberia; Angola; Argentina; Burma; Pakistan; Canada; India; and in the United States|USA in California and Colorado.
