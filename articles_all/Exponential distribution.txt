Time length of a telephone call
How long does it take to perform a service (for example, to fix something at a service point)
Amount of time between two phone calls
Half-life (element)|Half life of atoms (radioactive decay)
Expected lifetime of electronic (or other) parts, if wearing is not considered (this is called ''Mean Time Between Failures'', ''MTBF'')
