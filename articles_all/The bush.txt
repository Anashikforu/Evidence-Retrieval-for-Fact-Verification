'''The bush''' is a phrase used to describe land where people do not live, land a long way from cities, or forests. The word is mainly used in Australia, New Zealand, Africa, Canada, and Alaska. 


 Australia 
In Australia, the phrase, ''the bush'', has a special symbolic meaning in Australian life. When used to describe the land, ''the bush'' means a wooded area, but not dense forest. It is usually dry and nitrogen-poor soil, mostly grassless, with thin to thick woody shrubs and bushes, with some Eucalyptus|eucalypt trees.

When talking about people, ''the bush'' means any unpopulated areas outside of the major metropolitan areas. This can include mining and farming areas. It is not unusual to have a mining town in the desert, such as Port Hedland, Western Australia (Pop. 14,000) called ''the bush'' in the media.
The word bush is also added to any number of other words, things or activities to describe their rural, country or folk nature, e.g. "Cricket|Bush Cricket", "Folk music|Bush Music", etc.
