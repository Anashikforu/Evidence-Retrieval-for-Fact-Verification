A castle was built here and it was called ''Lucilinburhuc'' ("small castle"). In 963, this place became a property of Siegfried I of Luxembourg|Siegfried I, a close relative of the Emperors of Germany and Kings of France. Siegfried built a castle, not far from the "Lucilinburhuc" castle, on a Rock (geology)|rocky cliff called the ''Bock'' ().
