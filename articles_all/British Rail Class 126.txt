The introduction of what became the '''Class 126''' diesel multiple units originated in a British Transport Commission report of 1952 that suggested the trial use of diesel railcars. BR's Swindon Works were chosen to design and build express units for the ex-North British Railway Edinburgh Waverley to Glasgow Queen Street route. Swindon built a second batch in 1959/60 for use on services from Glasgow to Ayrshire.
