'''216 Kleopatra''' is a Asteroid belt|Main belt asteroid found by Johann Palisa on April 10, 1880 in Pula|Pola. It is named after Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra, the Queen of Egypt.



Kleopatra is an unusual object. Its odd shape was revealed by adaptive optics on the ESO 3.6m telescope at La Silla. By bouncing radar signals off the asteroid, a team of astronomers at the Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico were able to develop a more detailed computer model of its shape, which confirmed the dog-bone like shape. A favored explanation is that Kleopatra is a contact binary (asteroid)|contact binary: two similarly-sized asteroids that have hit and stuck together instead of breaking apart.

Kleopatra is a fairly big asteroid, measuring 217 × 94 × 81&nbsp;km. It is believed to be a loosely packed metallic object, based on its radar albedo.
