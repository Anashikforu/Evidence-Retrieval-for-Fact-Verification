'''Denis Joseph Savard''' (born February 4, 1961) is a Canadians|Canadian retired professional ice hockey Centre (ice hockey)|centre. Savard played 18 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Chicago Blackhawks, Montreal Canadiens, and the Tampa Bay Lightning.

He was drafted with the 3rd overall pick by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 1980 NHL Entry Draft. He was known for his trademark move, the 'Savardian Spin-o-rama', a move where Savard whirled around with the puck in a full rotation which allowed him to beat defenders and goaltenders. The term was actually coined by Danny Gallivan, referencing the move performed by Serge Savard.

On June 29, 1990, the Chicago Blackhawks traded Savard to the Montreal Canadiens for star defenceman Chris Chelios and a second-round pick (Mike Pomichter). The trade was considered to be largely in the Blackhawks' favor as Chelios would produce some of his best seasons as a Blackhawk while Savard's career was on the decline.

In the Summer of 1993, he signed as a free agent with the Tampa Bay Lightning, where he played 1Â½ seasons.

After he retired, he became the 36th head coach in Chicago Blackhawks history on November 27, 2006.
