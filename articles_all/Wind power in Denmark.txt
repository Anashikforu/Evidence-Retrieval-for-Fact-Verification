After the world's oil crises in the 1970s, Denmark started to develop wind power. In 1988, two years after the Chernobyl disaster, the Danes passed a law forbidding the construction of nuclear power plants.Caldicott, 2006, pp.168-169

The Danes were pioneers in developing commercial wind power during the 1970s and today almost half of the wind turbines around the world are produced by Danish manufacturers such as Vestas.

Wind power in Denmark provided 30% of the electricity produced in Denmark in 2012,International Energy Agency (2013). 
Wind turbines are popular with people in Denmark.
