'''''Tiktaalik''''' is a genus of extinction|extinct fish. This Sarcopterygii|sarcopterygian (lobe-finned) fish from the later Devonian has many features similar to those of tetrapods (four-legged animals).

''Tiktaalik'' lived about 375 million years ago. It is part of the transitional fossil|transition between fish such as ''Panderichthys'', known from fossils 380 million years old, and early tetrapods such as ''Acanthostega'' and ''Ichthyostega'', known from fossils about 365 million years old. Its mixture of basal fish and derived tetrapod characteristics led one of its discoverers, Neil Shubin, to call ''Tiktaalik'' a 'Tetrapodomorpha|fishapod'.John Noble Wilford, ''The New York Times'', 
This, and other species like it, prove that legs started to develop before these animals were land-based. They were shallow-water carnivorous fish, or fishapods.Clack, Jenny 2012. ''Gaining ground: the origin and early evolution of tetrapods''. 2nd ed, Bloominton, Indiana: Indiana University Press. ) ''Tiktaalik'' was therefore a transitional fossil, and an example of mosaic evolution.

''Panderichthys'', suited to muddy shallows;
''Tiktaalik'' with limb-like fins that could take it onto land;
Tetrapod|Early tetrapods in weed-filled swamps, such as:
  ''Acanthostega'' which had feet with eight digits,
  ''Ichthyostega'' with limbs.
Descendants also included pelagic lobe-finned coelacanth species.
