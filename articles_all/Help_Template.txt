If you have standard texts you want to include on several pages, the MediaWiki template feature comes into play.

Creation
Templates are standard wiki pages whose content is designed to be 
Usage
Templates are wiki pages which can be used in other pages in three ways:

 'transcludes' (i.e. includes a copy of) the content of the template (stored in the page Template:Name) whenever the page containing the template transclusion is fetched and displayed; i.e. if the template is later changed, the displayed transcluding page will automatically change too
 replaces that string with the contents of the template, in the source of the transcluding page, when you save that page; the copy of the template contents can then be edited normally (and separately from the original in the template page). '''''Note''''': don't use this if you are looking to continually propagate changes from the source template to the page(s) that references it.
 includes the template in a form that displays it as raw wiki syntax (the way &lt;nowiki&gt; does) when the page containing it is fetched

In fact, an ordinary wiki page can also be used as a template, simply by qualifying the namespace it resides in, so:

  includes Template:Pagename
       includes Foo:Pagename
          includes Pagename

If no such namespace exists, the full title is assumed to be a template:

            includes Template:Foo:Bar

=Parameters=



You can define parameters in templates either numbered as .  

'''Example:''' You want a little thank you note you can put on the talk page of other users. It will contain a reason and your signature. You could create Template:Thankyou to enter your text, as in the example in the table.

When using the template on a page, you fill in the parameter values, separated by a pipe char (|): .

You can also provide default values for parameters, i.e. values that are going to be used if no value is provided for a parameter. For example,  would result in ''"all your hard work"'' if no value was provided for the parameter reason.

=Control template inclusion=
You can control template inclusion by the use of  and
 tags.

Anything between  and  will be processed and
displayed only when the template's page is being viewed directly.

Possible applications are:
 Categorising templates
 Interlanguage links to similar templates in other languages
 Explanatory text about how to use the template

The converse is . Text between  and  will be processed and displayed only when the page is being included. The obvious application is to add all pages containing a given template to a Help:Categories|category, without putting the template itself into that category.

'''Note:''' when you change the categories applied by a template, the categorization of the pages that use that template may not be updated until some time later: this is handled by the .

=Organizing templates=
For templates to be effective users need to find them and be able to use them. A simple technique is to include an example on the template page.
For example:


 Usage 
Allows to establish a link to a subject:




Then, an editor can simply copy and paste the example to create a similar page.

Copying from one wiki to another
Templates often require # Copy the template text to the new wiki, either by # Look for CSS classes (like class="foobar") in the template text. If those classes appear in "MediaWiki:Common.css" or "MediaWiki:Monobook.css" on the original wiki, copy them to "MediaWiki:Common.css" on the new wiki.
# Look for templates (like ) inside the template text, and copy those templates to the new wiki.
# If the template uses Help:Extension:ParserFunctions|ParserFunctions, you must install the .
