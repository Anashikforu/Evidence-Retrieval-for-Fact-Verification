In crystallography, the '''crystal structure''' is how the atoms (or ions or molecules) are arranged in a crystal|crystalline material. Crystals occur naturally from the way the chemical bonds of the atoms connect. symmetry|Symmetric repeating patterns occur in 3-D space in the crystal.

The crystal structure and symmetry cause many physical properties, such as cleavage (how the crystal splits) how it conducts electricity, and its optics|optical properties..

The crystal structure of a chemical is the shape of the crystal at the molecular level. There are several shapes of crystals. Sodium chloride is a cube. Copper sulfate is triclinic. Most things, even metals, have crystal structures. Some crystals fit more atoms in them than others, and these crystals usually weigh more.
