In mathematics, the word "'''division'''" means the Operation (mathematics)|operation which is the opposite of multiplication. The symbols for division are the slash (/) and the Fraction (mathematics)|fraction line, as in:

: 6/3  or  \frac 63

where each of the three expressions means "6 divided by 3", with 2 as the answer. The first number is the '''dividend''' (6), and the second number is the '''divisor''' (3). The result (or answer) of a division is the quotient, where any left-over amount as Integer|whole numbers is called the "remainder". For example, 14/4 gives quotient 3 with remainder 2, all expressed as the mixed number 3\frac12 or 3.5).

The numbers involved in division can be very big, such as the case with two hundred: 200/5=40, or with 7 billion: 7,000,000,000/1000 = 7,000,000 (where the quotient is equal to 7 million).

 With multiplication 
If c times b equals a, written as:

: c \cdot b = a

where ''b'' is not zero, then a divided by ''b'' equals ''c'', written as:

: \frac ab = c

For instance,

: \frac 63 = 2

since

: 2 \cdot 3 = 6.

In the above expression, ''a'' is called the '''dividend''', ''b'' the '''divisor''' and ''c'' the '''quotient'''.

Division by zero, as in

: \frac x0

is not defined.

 Notation 
Division is most often shown by placing the ''dividend'' over the ''divisor'' with a horizontal line, also called a Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum, between them. For example, a divided by b is written as

: \frac ab

This can be read as "a divided by b", or "a over b". A way to express division all on one line is to write the ''dividend'', then a Slash (punctuation)|slash, then the ''divisor'', like this:

: a/b

This is the usual way to specify division in most computer Programming language|programming languages, since it can easily be typed as a simple sequence of characters.

A typographical variation which is halfway between these two forms uses a slash, but elevates the dividend and lowers the divisor:

: ''a''‚ÅÑ''b''

Any of these forms can be used to display a Fraction (mathematics)|fraction. A fraction is a division expression where both dividend and divisor are Integer|integers (in which case, the two numbers are typically referred to as ''numerator'' and ''denominator''). A fraction is an accepted way of writing numbers. It is not always expected that the result of the division is written in decimals.

In some non-English language|English-speaking cultures, "''a'' divided by ''b''" is written as a:b. However, in English-speaking countries the Colon (punctuation)|colon is restricted to expressing the related concept of Ratio|ratios (where a:b reads "''a'' is to ''b''").
