'''Charles VII of France''' (22 February 1403 – 22 July 1461), was King of France from 1422 to his death. He was not coronation|crowned as king until 1429 because England controlled large parts of France. His father, Charles VI of France, had disinherited him. He was called “King of Bourges” because Bourges was one of the few places he still controlled.

Joan of Arc took back land for him, but she was burned at the stake after he refused to pay her ransom. The Hundred Years' War ended while Charles VII was king. The English were left with only a small area around Calais
