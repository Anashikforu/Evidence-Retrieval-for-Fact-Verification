A '''paddle''' is a tool used for pushing against liquids, either for propulsion in a boat or for mix|mixing liquids.

Paddles commonly used in canoes consist of a wooden, fibreglass or metal rod (the ''shaft'') with a handle on one end and a rigid sheet (the ''blade'') on the other end.  Paddles for use in kayaks are longer, with a blade on each end, and usually no handles.
