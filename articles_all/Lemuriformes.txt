'''Lemuriformes'''  are an order (biology)|infraorder of Primates. It combines the lemurs of Madagascar, with the galagos and lorises of Africa and Asia.

The lorises and lemurs are a monophyletic clade.Szalay F.S. & Delson E. 1980. ''Evolutionary history of the primates''. Academic Press. 

 Evolutionary history 
Lemuriform origins are unclear and debated. The main problem is a lack of clear transitional fossils.Rose K.D. 2006. ''The beginning of the age of mammals''. Johns Hopkins University Press, p179–181. 

Molecular clock estimates suggest that lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the Paleocene, about 62&nbsp;mya.  Between 47 and 54&nbsp;mya, lemurs got to Madagascar by Oceanic dispersal|rafting.Vaughan T; Ryan J. & Czaplewski N. 2011. Chapter 12: Primates. In ''Mammalogy''. 5th ed, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 169–179. 

In Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the Eocene, about 40&nbsp;mya. Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, they have had to compete with monkeys and apes, as well as other mammals.

 Adapiformes 
Because the skeletons of adapiforms share strong similarities with those of lemurs and lorises, researchers have often referred to them as "primitive" strepsirrhines, lemur ancestors, or a sister group to the living strepsirrhines.  They are included in Strepsirrhini, and are considered basal members of the clade.Covert H.H. 2002. Chapter 3: The earliest fossil primates and the evolution of prosimians: Introduction. In Hartwig W.C (ed) ''The primate fossil record''. Cambridge University Press, p18. 

Although their status as true primates is not questioned, their relationship with other primates in Strepsirrhini is unclear. Sometimes they are put in their own infraorder; sometimes they are sometimes reduced to families in the Lemuriformes.
