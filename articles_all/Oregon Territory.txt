The '''Oregon Territory''' is the name that was applied first to the unorganized British Columbia#Oregon Dispute|Oregon Country claimed by both the United States and United Kingdom|Britain (but normally referred to as the Oregon Country). In 1846 the two countries agreed to split this territory. The Organized incorporated territories of the United States|organized U.S. territory formed from the southern part was also called "Oregon Territory" when it existed, between 1848 and 1859. 

The Territory of Oregon was organized on August 14, 1848, by an act of United States Congress|Congress out of the U.S. portion of the Oregon Country below the 49th parallel north.Corning, Howard M.
