Height controversy
On November 8, 2013, architects in Chicago and New York City began debating about the height of the One World Trade Center and the Willis Tower.  They were saying that there was a possibility that the Willis Tower is taller than the One World Trade Center.

On November 12, a committee agreed that the antenna on top is part of the building, so One World Trade Center is taller than the Willis Tower.

Even after removing the antennas from the measurement, One World Trade Center is about 325&nbsp;feet (99 m) taller than the Willis Tower.
