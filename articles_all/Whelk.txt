 In North America ''whelk'' refers to several large edible species in the genera ''Busycon'' and ''Busycotypus'' in the family Melongenidae. These are sometimes called ''Busycon whelks''. In the United States, the invasive Murex ''Rapana venosa'' is referred to as the ''Veined rapa whelk'' or ''Asian rapa whelk''.

 In the English-speaking islands of the West Indies, the word ''whelks'' or ''wilks''  is both singular and plural. It is used for a large edible top shell, ''Cittarium pica'', also known as the ''magpie'' or ''West Indian top shell''.

 In Australia and New Zealand, species of the genus ''Cabestana'' are called ''predatory whelks''.
