In cryptography, a '''pre-shared key''' or '''PSK''' is a shared secret which was previously shared between the two parties using some secure channel before it is used. Such systems almost always use Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric key cryptographic algorithms. 

The characteristics of this shared secret|secret or Key (cryptography)|key are determined by the system which uses it; some system require that such keys be in a specific format. It can be a password like 'bret13i', a passphrase like 'Idaho hung gear id gene', or a hexadecimal string like '65E4 E556 8622 EEE1'. The secret is used by all systems involved in the cryptographic processes used to secure the traffic between the systems.  

The term is used in Wi-Fi encryption such as Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP or Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA, where both the Access point|wireless access points (AP) and all clients ''share'' the same key.   

Since one weakpoint of the Cryptosystem|crypto system is the encryption algorithm's Key (cryptography)|key, the Key strengthening|key strength is important, and since the strength of a key is in part dependent on the key size|key length, it is important to choose a key whose length is Brute force attack|cryptographically secure (see password strength). There are several tools available to help one choose a strong key.  The Diceware|Diceware method is one example.
