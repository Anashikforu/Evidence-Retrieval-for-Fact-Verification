Loanwords
Khowar has many loanwords taken from Hindustani, Persian, and Ghalchah. It also has words from Sanskrit and Ancient Greek.

In the 19th century, when the area was conquered by Hindustanis, many words from the Hindustani languages entered Kho, like ''afas'' from the Hindustani ''aas'', which means hope; ''ruphi'' from the Hindustani ''rukna''. which means to stop; ''usna'' from the Hindustani ''uthana'', which means to lift up; and ''choghi'' from the Hindustani ''chori'', which means to steal.
