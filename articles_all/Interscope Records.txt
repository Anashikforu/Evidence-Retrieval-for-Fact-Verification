'''Interscope Records''' is an United States|American major record label. It is owned by Universal Music Group. The label was founded by Jimmy Lovine and Ted Field as a joint venture with Atlantic Records. One of the main features of the company was weak control over the musicians, which allowed them to freely implement their ideas in creativity.  

In 1992, Interscope acquired the exclusive distribution rights for the releases of hip-hop-specialized label Death Row Records, whose artists were the then popular rappers Tupac Shakur, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Subsequently, due to the distribution of the gangsta rap albums by the company, the label was embroiled in significant conflict with members of the public. As a result, in 1995 Time Warner, owner of Universal Music Group, severed ties with Interscope, selling 50% of the shares to Field and Lovine for $115 million. In 1996, 50% of the shares were bought for $ 200 million by MCA Music Entertainment Group, later known as Universal Music Group.
