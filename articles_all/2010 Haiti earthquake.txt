The earthquake caused major damage to Port-au-Prince. Most major landmarks were badly damaged or destroyed. The National Palace (Haiti)|Presidential Palace, the National Assembly of Haiti|National Assembly building, the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, and the city's main jails were all destroyed.

Many different countries started raising money and sent medical teams or search and rescue teams to Haiti. The Dominican Republic, which is next to Haiti, was the first country to give aid. This helped reduce some bad feelings between the two countries that had been there a long time.

But it takes a long time to rebuild a city and the area around it.  Just finding places to move all the broken parts of buildings was difficult.  And countries promise money to help rebuild, but it takes a while to get the money, and in most disasters, only half the money that is promised is actually sent. The country is still recovering to this day.
