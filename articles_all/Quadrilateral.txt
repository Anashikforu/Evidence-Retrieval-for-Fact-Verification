In Euclidean geometry|Euclidean plane geometry, a '''quadrilateral''' is a polygon with four Edge (geometry)|edges (or sides) and four Vertex (geometry)|vertices (or corners). Sometimes, the term '''quadrangle''' is used (similar to the term "triangle"), while other times, the term '''tetragon''' is used (similar to pentagon, 5-sided polygon, and hexagon, 6-sided polygon). A quadrilateral with vertices A, B, C, D is sometimes written as \square ABCD.

The origin of the word quadrilateral is the two Latin words ''quadri'', a variant of four, and ''latus'', meaning "side".

Quadrilaterals can be either complex polygon|complex, also called crossed (self-intersecting), or simple polygon|simple (not self-intersecting). Simple quadrilaterals are either convex polygon|convex or concave polygon|concave.

All the sides of a quadrilateral are straight, and the Internal and external angle|interior angles of a quadrilateral add up to 360°.

:\angle A+\angle B+\angle C+\angle D=360^{\circ}.

This is a special case of the ''n''-gon interior angle sum formula: (''n'' − 2) × 180°.

All non-self-crossing quadrilaterals tessellation|tile the plane, by repeated rotation around the midpoints of their edges.

There are 6 special kinds of quadrilaterals; square, rectangle, rhombus, parallelogram, kite (geometry)|kite, and trapezoid. Technically, squares, rectangles, and rhombuses are types of parallelograms.
