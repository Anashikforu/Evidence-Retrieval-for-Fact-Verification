In linguistics, '''syntax''' is the study of the rules that govern the structure of sentences. 

The term ''syntax'' can also be used to refer to these rules themselves, as in “the syntax of a language”. Modern research in syntax attempts to describe languages in terms of such rules, and, for many practitioners, to find general rules that apply to all languages.
