A '''genetic disorder''' is a health problem caused by abnormalities in the genome. They are heritable, and ''may'' be passed down from the parents' genes to their children and to later generations. If a genetic disorder is present from birth, it is described as a congenital defect. Some defects only show up in later life.  

The mutation responsible can occur spontaneously before the embryo develops, or it can be Heredity|inherited from parents who are carriers of a faulty gene.

Most genetic disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several thousands or even millions. Sometimes they are relatively frequent in a population. If they are frequent, it suggests these recessive gene disorders give an Heterozygote advantage|advantage in certain environments when only one copy of the gene is present.
The same disease, such as some forms of cancer, may be caused by an inherited genetic condition in some people, by new mutations in other people, and by nongenetic causes in still other people. A disease is only called a genetic disease if it can be heritable|inherited.
