A '''vinculum''' is a wikt:horizontal|horizontal line put over a mathematical expression. It shows that it belongs together as a group. (''Vinculum'' is Latin for "chain".)

Examples are:

1. groups of digits wikt:repeat|repeating forever, for example,

:\frac{1}{3} = 0.333333\dots = 0.\overline{3}

2. Fraction (mathematics)|fractions

:\frac{500}{10 \times 10} = \frac{5}{1} = 5

3. radical (mathematics)|radicals (in the following example the quantity ab+2 is the radicand, and thus has a vinculum over it):

:\sqrtn{ab+2}
