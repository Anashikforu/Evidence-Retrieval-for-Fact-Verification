'''Electric power''' is defined as the power dissipated by an electric circuit. Electric power is a measurement of the rate at which energy is used over a period of time. The SI unit for power is the watt, the unit for energy is the joule, and the unit for time is the second.

For a direct current circuit, electric power equals the electric current multiplied by the voltage.

When electric current flows through a circuit, it is slowed down by the electrical resistance|resistance in the circuit. Devices can convert this current to useful forms of work (physics)|work, such as heat radiation, light emission, kinetic energy|mechanical motion, or sound|acoustic vibrations.
