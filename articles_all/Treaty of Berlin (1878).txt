The '''Treaty of Berlin''' was a part of the Congress of Berlin (June 13-July 13, 1878). In it, the United Kingdom, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the Ottoman Empire wrote the Treaty of San Stefano.

 Problems 
= Bulgaria =
The most important problem in the treaty was deciding what would happen to the Kingdom of Bulgaria. However, Russia insisted that Bulgaria should not be mentioned in the treaty.Krasner, p.165 The Treaty of San Stefano had created a huge Bulgarian state, which was just what the United Kings and Austria-Hungary did not want since Russia would become too powerful.

= Independence =
The treaty stated that Romania, Serbia and Montenegro were to become independent. The Ottoman province of Bosnia-Herzegovina was to be occupied by Austria-Hungary.

The three newly-independent states soon declared themselves to be kingdoms (Romania in 1881, Serbia in 1882 and Montenegro in 1910). Austria-Hungary officially took over Bosnia in 1908, which caused a Bosnian crisis|major European crisis.
