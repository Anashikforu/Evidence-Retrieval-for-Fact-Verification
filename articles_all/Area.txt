'''Area''' is the amount of Space (physics)|space a two dimensional (flat) surface takes up. It is useful because it is how much of a material is needed to make a hollow container.  Area is the amount of surface covered by a close object or shape. 

Some units used to measure area are square foot, square mile, square metre and square kilometre. The area of a planar figure is often written as A.

One can use different formulas to find the area of different shapes. For example:


 Area of a rectangle is the length of any two touching sides multiply|multiplied together. In other words, length times width.
 Area of a triangle is half of the base multiplied by the perpendicular height. In other words, A = \tfrac{1}{2} bh.
 Area of a circle: A = \pi r^2

The area of a flat object is related to the surface area and volume of a three-dimensional object.

The area under a curve can be found using integral|integration, a concept from calculus.
