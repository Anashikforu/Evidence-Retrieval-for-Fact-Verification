'''D major''' is a  major scale based on D (musical note)|D. Its key signature has two sharps.  Its relative key|relative minor is B minor.

D major is good for violin music because of the structure of the instrument, which has its four strings tuned to G D A E.  The open strings resonate with the D string, producing a special rich sound.

Because of this, many Western classical music|classical composers chose to write violin concertos in D major. Examples include Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's (Violin Concerto No. 2 (Mozart)|No. 2, 1775, Violin Concerto No. 4 (Mozart)|No. 4, 1775); Ludwig van Beethoven's (Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|1806); Niccolò Paganini|Paganini's (Violin Concerto No. 1 (Paganini)|No. 1, 1817); Johannes Brahms|Brahms's (Violin Concerto (Brahms)|1878); Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky's (Violin Concerto (Tchaikovsky)|1878); Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev's (Violin Concerto No. 1 (Prokofiev)|No. 1, 1917); Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky's (Violin Concerto (Stravinsky)|1931); and Erich Wolfgang Korngold|Korngold's (Violin Concerto (Korngold)|1945).


It is also suitable for guitar music, with drop tuning for the lowest string making two Ds as open strings.

For some beginning wind instrument students, however, D major is not a very good key, because it transposes to E major for B flat instruments. E major has four sharps, which is harder for new learners to play.

Still, the clarinet in B-flat is often used for music in D major. It is probably the key with the most sharps that it can play well. However, when some composers write a piece in D minor with B-flat clarinets, they change to clarinets in A if the music changes to D major.

Most tin whistles are in D, because they are often used in music with fiddles.

In the Baroque music|Baroque period, D major was seen as "the key of glory";Rita Steblin: A History of Key Characteristics in the Eighteenth and Early Nineteenth Centuries (Rochester, University of Rochester Press: 1996) p. 124 "The key of triumph, of Hallelujahs, of war-cries, of victory-rejoicing." so many trumpet pieces were in D major. Examples include concertos by Fasch, Gross, Johann Melchior Molter|Molter (No. 2), Leopold Mozart, Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann (No. 2), and Giuseppe Torelli; sonatas by Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli, Franceschini, Henry Purcell|Purcell, Torelli; and "The Trumpet Shall Sound" and the "Hallelujah" chorus from Handel's ''Messiah (Handel)|Messiah''.

After the valve trumpet was invented, composers began to write for trumpet in keys with more flats, so Joseph Haydn|Haydn wrote his famous trumpet concerto in the key of E-flat major.

23 of Haydn's 104 symphonies are in D major, making it the most often used main key of his symphonies. A great number of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's unnumbered symphonies are in D major, namely Köchel number|K. 66c, 81/73, 97/73m, 95/73n, 120/111a and 161/163/141a. The symphony came from the overture, and "D major was by far the most common key for overtures in the second half of the eighteenth century."

Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin saw D major as golden in color and when he talked to Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov, he gave an example from one of Rimsky-Korsakov's own operas where a character sang in D major about gold.
