Story
Mario and his friends set out to collect eight Pure Hearts in each chapters, in order to destroy the Chaos Heart and prevent the black hole from destroying the world.

Companions
In each ''Paper Mario'' game, there have always been members that follow Mario and help him in battles. Pixl is a name that comes from the word pixel, but is also a reference to pixie, which is a name for a fairy. Each pixl has a different power and look, but despite having many members, the player can only use one. In ''Super Paper Mario'', Tippi, also called Tiptron, is the player's butterfly partner. She has the ability to give tips to Mario and makes invisible objects appear. The player can recruit one of the Pixls in each chapters as the game progresses.
