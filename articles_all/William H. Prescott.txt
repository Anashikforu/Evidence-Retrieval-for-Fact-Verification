Both were about Italian poetry.Rossi, Joseph ''The Italian Poems of Thomas James Mathias'', 1943, printed in ''Modern Language Quarterly'', p. 331 However, Prescott became interested in the history of Spain due to his friend George Ticknor, who had become professor of Spanish studies at Harvard University.Peck, p. 48 Prescott decided that he wanted to write a book about Ferdinand and Isabella, who were King and Queen of Spain in the early 1500s, in January 1826.Ticknor, 1864, p. 76  After gathering source material, Prescott started writing  the ''History of Ferdinand and Isabella'' in October 1829.Ticknor, 1864, p. 94 He had finished it by July 1836.Griswold, 1847, p. 372 It was published on Christmas Day, 1837 by the ''American Stationary Company'', which was based in Boston, with a print run of 500&nbsp;copies.Gardiner, p. 138 Prescott dedication|dedicated the book to his father.

 Philanthropy 
Due in part to his own condition, Prescott was interested in aiding the blind and partially sighted. The Perkins School for the Blind, then known as the New England Asylum,  had been founded in Watertown, Massachusetts by Samuel Gridley Howe, Thomas Handasyd Perkins and John Dix Fisher and 28 others in 1829.Gardiner, p. 108 Prescott involved himself from the very start of the project, becoming a trustee in 1830. He published an article in support of education for the blind in the ''North American Review'' of July 1830, and helped to raise $50,000 for the organization in May 1833.Ticknor, 1864, p. 253Gardiner, p. 119
 Personal life 
His work was disturbed in February 1829 by the unexpected death of his eldest daughter Catherine, who was only four years old. This led him to reconsider his position on religion—previously an agnostic, his interest in Christianity was renewed, and having read the Bible, the works of the theologian William Paley as well as more skeptical works such as David Hume|Hume's ''On Miracles'', he came to acknowledge the "moral truth" of the gospels, while remaining opposed to the doctrines of orthodox Christianity.Ticknor, 1864, pp. 91, 152.
In 1835, he took residence in the rural town of Nahant, Massachusetts, due to concerns about his health.Ticknor, 1864, p. 99 He was here accustomed to riding his horses for the purpose of exercise, and he persevered even in sub-zero temperatures.Ticknor, 1864, p. 127
