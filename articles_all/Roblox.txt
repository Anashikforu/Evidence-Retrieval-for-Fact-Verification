 History

Roblox had a big change in 2006. In January 2006, Roblox removed their special points and made multiplayer, but the API was never used until March 2006. In February 2006, Roblox left beta and was made free for all players. In September 2006, Roblox made changes to the multiplayer API so that players could make their own multiplayer games for free instead of the Roblox developers making them. 

In May 2007, the Roblox developers began making virtual items, and its first virtual item was a top hat. Roblox also started the Builders Club which is a paid membership.

Guest mode, which is for players that want to play Roblox without making an account, was introduced in 2008. Later, higher forms of the Builders Club (known as the Turbo Builders Club and the Outrageous Builders Club) were started in 2009.

Game creation
Roblox lets its players create their own games using its own separate app, Roblox Studio. Players can build anything they want to using the Studio, and then publish their game to the Roblox website for anyone to play. 

 Virtual items and currency 
Players on Roblox can buy virtual items from the Catalog using virtual currency named 'Robux'. This currency is obtained initially by buying a Roblox Premium membership or from a gift card, but can also be made by selling items like gamepasses, or accessories, which other players can buy with their own Robux. It can be used by players to buy accessories and items for their character, or in game benefits.

Another form of currency that was discontinued was the Tix, also known as Tickets. All players could get a few Tix each day they log into Roblox, and trade those Tix in to get Robux. Tix were removed from the game in March 2016. 

Membership

Builders Club was Roblox's first membership club which could only be used through a purchase. Builders Club gave its members more features in Roblox, such as earning its virtual currency called Robux, and the ability to trade items. Another thing players could do was sell Limited items (buy-able and sell-able items on the Avatar Shop). There were three types of Builders Club: Classic, Turbo, and Outrageous. Classic was the original Builders Club type and Outrageous was the newest. Players would either buy it monthly or annually. 

In 2019, Builder's Club was removed and replaced with Premium. Premium is very much like the original Builders Club except it gives players Robux every month instead of daily. Premium players also get access to perks in select games.
