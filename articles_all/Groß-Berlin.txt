'''Groß-Berlin''' or Greater Berlin was created by an act of the Prussian parliament made on 27 April 1920. The act was called the Greater Berlin Act ().

The act said that on 1 October 1920 ''Greater Berlin'' should be taken away from the Province of Brandenburg and become a new district.

The new district was made up of:
 The city of Berlin (''Alt-Berlin'');
 7 towns that surrounded Berlin:
 Charlottenburg,
 Köpenick,
 Lichtenberg,
 Neukölln,
 Schöneberg,
 Spandau and
 Wilmersdorf;
 59 rural areas and 27 estate districts from the surrounding districts of Niederbarnim (district)|Niederbarnim, Osthavelland (district)|Osthavelland and Teltow (district)|Teltow;
 and the grounds of the Berliner Stadtschloss (the Royal Palace) which had formed an estate district in its own right.

The new Berlin was 13 times bigger than the old. Its area went from  and the population doubled from approximately 1.9 million to near 4 million, with almost 1.2 million of these new inhabitants coming from the 7 surrounding towns alone.

Groß-Berlin was divided into 20 Boroughs and localities of Berlin|boroughs (''Verwaltungsbezirke''):
 from Alt-Berlin:
 Mitte,
 Tiergarten,
 Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding,
 Prenzlauer Berg,
 Kreuzberg and
 Friedrichshain;
 one borough for each of the 7 previously-independent towns:
 Charlottenburg,
 Köpenick,
 Lichtenberg,
 Neukölln,
 Schöneberg,
 Spandau and
 Wilmersdorf;
 7 new boroughs named after the largest village in the old areas:
 Pankow,
 Reinickendorf,
 Steglitz,
 Tempelhof,
 Treptow,
 Berlin-Weißensee|Weißensee and
 Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf

Apart from minor changes, the city boundary defined in the law is the same as today, except for some changes made during the time of the Berlin Wall. During the 1970s and 1980s three new boroughs were made in East Berlin when other boroughs were split up.
