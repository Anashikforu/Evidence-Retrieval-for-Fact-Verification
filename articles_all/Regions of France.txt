France is split into 18 administrative '''regions''' (''regions''). These regions are a kind of local government.

Thirteen regions are in Metropolitan France (the part of the country that is in Europe). Each region contains a few of the Departments of France. Corsica has a different status than the other 12 metropolitan regions. It is called ''collectivist territorial''. Five regions are overseas.

There used to be 27 regions. In 2016, some regions were combined and there are now 18.
