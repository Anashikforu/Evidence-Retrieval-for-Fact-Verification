The ''On the Origin of Species|Origin of Species'' is the most important single book in the biological sciences, and its main ideas are well-supported by modern research.Bowler, Peter J. 2003. ''Evolution: the history of an idea''. 3rd ed, University of California Press, 

''The Voyage of the Beagle'' (1839) and ''The Descent of Man'' (1871) are also highly important.

Several of the other books were also ground-breaking.
