 

The '''5.56Ã—45mm NATO''' Round (firearms)|round, pronounced "'''five-five-six'''", is an intermediate cartridge and the main bullet type used by Gun|guns made for NATO Military|militaries. It was first used in the Vietnam War as the main bullet used by the Military of the United States|US military. 

Early in the Vietnam War, the main gun used by American Soldier|soldiers was the M14 rifle|M14. Many soldiers complained that the 7.62 x 51mm NATO|7.62mm NATO round used by the M14 was too heavy and that the gun Recoil|kicked back too hard to shoot accurately when shooting in Automatic firearm|full-automatic fire. To solve this problem, the US military decided replace the M14 and the 7.62mm NATO by creating a new assault rifle that would shoot lighter bullets with less Recoil|kickback. That gun would be the M16 rifle|M16A1, the first standard issue gun to fire the 5.56mm NATO bullet.

Even though the M16A1 had many design flaws that would cause the gun to Jam (firearms)|jam, the 5.56 bullet performed well in battle. The 5.56 did so well that the Soviet Union made its own intermediate cartridge, the 5.45 x 39mm, to compete with NATO.

Guns that use the 5.56 include the M16 rifle|M16, the M4 carbine, the AR-15, the FAMAS, the Heckler & Koch G36|G36, the SCAR-L rifle|SCAR-L, and the Mini-14 rifle|Mini-14.
