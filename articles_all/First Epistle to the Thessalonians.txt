The '''First Epistle to the Thessalonians''' is the fifty-second book in the Christian Bible, and the thirteenth in the New Testament.

This book is believed to a letter from the Twelve Apostles|Apostle Paul of Tarsus|Paul to a church in Thessaloniki|Thessalonica in modern-day Greece. It is likely the first of Pauline epistles|Paul's letters, probably written by the end of AD 52Raymond E. Brown, ''An Introduction to the New Testament'', Anchor Bible, 1997. pp. 456–466. (however, some scholars believe the Epistle to Galatians may have been written at an earlier date: AD 48).

Composition
Most New Testament scholars believe Paul wrote this letter from Corinth, most of the letter has personal information, with only the last two chapters teaching things about what Christians are to believe. Paul's main goal is to encourage and reassure the Christianity|Christians there. Paul tells them to go on working quietly while waiting in hope for the Second Coming|return of Christ.  Paul also teaches that the Resurrection|dead will be resurrected prior to those still living, and both groups will greet the Lord (Jesus) in the air. These verses are often read at funerals of Christians to comfort their families.

Unlike later Pauline epistles, 1 Thessalonians does not focus on sola fide|faith or questions of Jewish–Gentile relations, things that are covered in all his other letters. Many scholars see this as an indication that this letter was written before the Epistle to the Galatians, where Paul's teaching on these matters were given.
