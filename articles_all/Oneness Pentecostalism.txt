'''Oneness Pentecostalism''', also known as '''Apostolic Pentecostalism''', is a movement of Christianity that split from the Pentecostalism|Pentecostal movement, at around 1914. Followers believe that the Bible was Revelation|inspired by God. 

"''Oneness''" means that they believe that God is one being, not three persons (like in the Trinity doctrine), and that Jesus is God in human flesh â€“ fully god and fully human. This makes them different from most Unitarianism|Unitarians who say that the son of god was only man. "''Apostolic''" means that they follow the Apostolic doctrine (by the Twelve Apostles|12 Apostles in the early Christian Church|Church). "''Pentecostal''" means that they put an emphasis on the moving of the Holy Spirit (like speaking in tongues) as was done on the Day of Pentecost.
