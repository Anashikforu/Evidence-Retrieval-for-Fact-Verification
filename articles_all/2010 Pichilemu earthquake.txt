A '''6.9 earthquake''' occurred on March 11, 2010, 40&nbsp;kilometers southwest of Pichilemu, O'Higgins Region, Chile .

Although news media first reported the earthquake as an aftershock of the February earthquake, said it was a different earthquake. Though unchained by the regional stress caused by the February 2010 Chile earthquake|February 27 earthquake, the March event was not a fast adjustment to February's thrust fault rupture between the Nazca plate|Nazca and South American plates, but it was caused by normal faulting inside one of those plates. However, it has not been positively decided in which plate the earthquake occurred.

Within 6 hours, 10 aftershocks took place, of these 2 were of magnitude 6 or greater and 7 between magnitude 5 and 6.

The presidents of Bolivia, Paraguay, and Ecuador were present when the earthquake occurred, however, the television footage showed that the inauguration was not interrupted.
