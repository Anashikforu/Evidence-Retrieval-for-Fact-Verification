'''Antarctic krill''' (''Euphausia superba'') is a species of krill that lives in the Antarctica|Antarctic waters of the Southern Ocean. They are shrimp-like and belong to the invertebrates. 

They live in large groups, called swarms. Sometimes these swarms have a density of 10,000â€“30,000 individual animals per cubic metre|cubic meter. 

They feed directly on very small Plankton|phytoplankton, so they can use the energy that the phytoplankton originally got from the sun in order to sustain their life in the open ocean.

In aquarium|aquaria, krill have been observed to eat each other.
