The '''Southwestern Athletic Conference''' ('''SWAC''') is a list of college athletic conferences|college athletic conference based in Birmingham, Alabama. It is made up of historically black colleges and universities|historically black universities in the Southern United States. It participates in the National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's Division I (NCAA)|Division I for all sports. In American football|football, it participates in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).  

The SWAC is one of two conferences (the other being the Ivy League) which do not take part in postseason play in the FCS football tournament.  It is the only one of the two whose members offer a full range of scholarships for football.The Ivy League does not award athletic scholarships at all. Northeast Conference members are limited to 30 football scholarships, less than half the FCS scholarship limit of 63. Pioneer League members may offer scholarships in other sports, but do not award football scholarships, and do not allow athletes receiving scholarships in other sports to play football. The SWAC instead splits its schools into two divisions, and plays a conference championship game.  Furthermore, one SWAC game, the Bayou Classic between Southern and Grambling State, is positioned on the schedule after the NCAA tournament has begun. In addition, Alabama State plays NCAA Division II|Division II rival Tuskegee University|Tuskegee annually on Thanksgiving Day (The Turkey Day Classic).  

History
In 1920, athletic officials from six Texas HBCUs – C.H. Fuller of Bishop College, Red Randolph and C.H. Patterson of Paul Quinn College, E.G. Evans, H.J. Evans and H.J. Starns of Prairie View A&M, D.C. Fuller of Texas College and G. Whitte Jordan of Wiley College – met in Houston, Texas, to discuss common interests.  At this meeting, they agreed to form a new league, the SWAC.

Paul Quinn became the first of the original members to leave the league when it did so in 1929. When Langston University of Oklahoma was allowed into the conference two years later, it began the migration of state-supported institutions into the SWAC. Southern University entered the league in 1934. University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff|Arkansas AM&N entered in 1936 and Texas Southern University in 1954. 

As the state-supported schools became bigger, it became difficult for the church-supported schools to pay for their sports teams. Soon the church-supported schools started to leave the conference.   Bishop College|Bishop withdrew from the conference in 1956, Langston in 1957 and Huston-Tillotson University|Huston-Tillotson (formerly Samuel Huston) in 1959.  That happened one year after two more state-supported schools entered the league (Grambling College and Jackson State College). The enter-exit cycle continued in 1961 when Texas College withdrew, followed by the entrance of Alcorn A&M in 1962. Wiley left in 1968, the same year Mississippi Valley State College entered. Arkansas AM&N exited in 1970 and Alabama State University entered in 1982. Arkansas-Pine Bluff (formerly Arkansas AM&N) rejoined the SWAC on July 1, 1997, regaining full-member status one year later. Alabama A&M University became the conference’s tenth member when it became a full member in September, 1999 after a one year period as an affiliate SWAC member.

Current championship competition offered by the SWAC includes competition for men in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, indoor track, outdoor track & field and tennis. Women’s competition is offered in the sports of basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, indoor track, outdoor track & field, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball.
