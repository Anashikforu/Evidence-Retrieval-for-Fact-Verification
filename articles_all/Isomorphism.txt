In mathematics (particularly in abstract algebra), two Structure (mathematics)|mathematical structures are isomorphic when they are the same in some sense. More specifically, an '''isomorphism''' is a Function (mathematics)|function between two structures that preserves the relationships between the parts. To indicate isomorphism between two structures \mathcal{A}  and \mathcal{B}, one often writes \mathcal{A} \cong \mathcal{B}.  

Using the language of category theory, this means that Morphism|morphisms map to morphisms without breaking composition. An isomorphism is also a homomorphism that is one-to-one.  

As an example, one can consider the operation of adding integers '''Z'''. The doubling function φ(x) = 2x maps elements of '''Z''' to elements of the even integers '''2Z'''. Since φ(a+b) = 2(a+b) = 2a+2b = φ(a)+φ(b), adding in '''Z''' is structurally identical as adding in '''2Z''' (which makes this an example of isomorphism).
