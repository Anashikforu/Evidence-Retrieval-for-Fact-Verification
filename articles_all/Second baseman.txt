'''Second base''', or ''2B'', is the second of four places on a baseball field which must be touched in order by a base runner before he can score a run for that player's team. This makes it easier to turn a double play. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4.

Current second basemen include Chase Utley, Robinson Cano, Dustin Pedroia, Orlando Hudson, Aaron Hill (baseball)|Aaron Hill and Ben Zobrist.
