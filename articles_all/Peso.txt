The '''''peso''''' is the monetary unit of several countries in the Americas and the Philippines. Originating in Spain, the word ''peso'' translates to "weight" and uses the peso sign ("$"; "â‚±" in the Philippines).

The silver ''peso'' worth eight ''reales'' was also known in English as a Spanish dollar or "piece of eight" and was a widely used international trade coin from the 16th to 19th centuries.
