'''Deposition''' is the Geology|geological process where material is added to a land (or a landform). This can happen in many places, such as a beach or river. Some parts of a shore|shoreline build up and grow out, whereas other parts of the shoreline erosion|erode and fall into the sea.

In deposition, wind and water lay down grains of material that have been Erosion|eroded and transported from another place. Deposition happens when the forces which transport sediments  are weaker than the forces of particle weight and friction. This causes a resistance to movement, and the particles drop down. 

Deposition can also refer to the buildup of sediment from organically derived matter or chemical process.
