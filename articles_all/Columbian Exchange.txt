The '''Columbian Exchange''', sometimes called the '''Grand Exchange''' was the exchange of goods and ideas from Europe, Africa, and Asia and goods and ideas from the Americas. It also spread different diseases. It started in 1492 when Christopher Columbus arrived in the West Indies (North America).

This exchange of plants and animals changed European, Americas|American, African, and Asian ways of life.  Foods that had never been seen before by people became a major part of what they ate.  For example, before 1492, no potatoes were grown outside of South America.  By the  1840s, Ireland was so dependent on the potato that a diseased crop led to the devastating Irish Potato Famine.
Before the Columbian Exchange, there were no orange (fruit)|oranges in Florida, no bananas in Ecuador, no paprika in Hungary, no zucchini in Italy, no pineapples in Hawaii, no rubber trees in Africa, no cattle in Texas, no chili peppers in Thailand and India, no cigarettes in France and no chocolate in Switzerland.  Even the dandelion was brought to Americas|America by Europe|Europeans for use as an herb.  

Before there was regular communication between the two hemispheres, the different types of domesticated animals and diseases were more numerous in the Old World than in the New.  This partly led to the horrible effects of Old World diseases on Native American tribes. Smallpox probably caused in the highest death toll for Native Americans.   

Barely any civilization on earth stayed the same by this global ecological exchange.
