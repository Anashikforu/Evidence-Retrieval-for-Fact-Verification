'''Puerto Morelos''' is a town in Quintana Roo, Mexico's easternmost state, on the Yucat√°n Peninsula.

There are two parts to Puerto Morelos. The original coastal fishing village is now a laid-back, mixed-use neighborhood of private homes, hotels, condominiums, restaurants, and tourist shops. The second part is about 2 km inland and adjacent to Highway 307, on the western side. The inland portion is mainly single level dwellings for the local workers.
