'''Tropical Storm Cristobal''' was a cyclone that formed in August of 2002. It stayed away from land for most of its life. However, when it died out, what was left of the storm caused rain and wind on Bermuda. It also caused stormy seas that caused three people to drown near Long Island. No severe damage happened.

Storm history

A cyclone formed on August 5. At that time, it was located about 175&nbsp;miles (280&nbsp;km/h) to the east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. The storm then moved towards the southeast. However, the storm gained enough strength to be named Tropical Storm Cristobal on August 6.

The tropical storm was still moving towards the southeast when it became Cristobal.

Effects
Cristobal stayed mostly away from land while it was a tropical cyclone. Two ships in the ocean reported high winds because of the storm.
