A portion of it, the Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu District, is sometimes called the "city of Honolulu" for statistical reasons, although it has no government separate from that of the "City and County" as a whole. The U.S. Census Bureau defines Honolulu CDP (Census Designated Place) as the Honolulu District. For Hawaii, the largest CDPs are listed.

#fn 2 back|Note 2:  As of June 2013, New Orleans remains at a population of 343,829 (according to the 2010 Census) still showing a long term decrease since Hurricane Katrina, which initially decreased the population of the city by about 50%.  Many of the city's residents were displaced during the storm and it is still unknown how many will return or can be considered "displaced".
