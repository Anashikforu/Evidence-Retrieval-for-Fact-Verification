'''The Angel''' was originally an inn near a toll gate on the Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road (at what is now the corner of Islington High Street and Pentonville Road). The term now informally refers to this part of Islington in London. The corner itself is actually in Finsbury which was a separate borough until 1965 when the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury merged with the Metropolitan Borough of Islington to form the London Borough of Islington.
