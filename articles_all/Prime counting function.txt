In mathematics, the '''prime counting function''' is the Function (mathematics)|function counting the number of prime numbers less than or equal to some real number ''x''. It is written as \pi(x), but it is not related to the number Pi (mathematical constant)|π. Some key values of the function include \pi(1)=0, \pi(2)=1 and \pi(3)=2.

In general, if p_nstands for the ''n''-th prime number, then \pi(p_n)=n.
