In rowing, a '''coxless pair''' consists of a pair of rowers, each having one oar, one on the stroke side (rower's right hand side) and one on the bow (ship)|bow side (rower's lefthand side). As the name suggests, there is no Coxswain (rowing)|cox on such a boat, and the two rowers must co-ordinate steering and the proper timing of oar strokes between themselves.
