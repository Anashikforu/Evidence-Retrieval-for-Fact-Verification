'''United States National Academy of Engineering''' ('''NAE'''), a private, non-profit institution that was founded in 1964.
New members of the organization are elected annually by current members composed of senior professionals in business, academia, and government who are among the worldâ€™s most accomplished engineers in one or both of the following categories:
 Engineering research, practice, or education, including, where appropriate, significant contributions to the engineering literature.
 Pioneering of new and developing fields of technology, making major advancements in traditional fields of engineering, or developing/implementing innovative approaches to engineering education.

The Academy annually awards three prizes that award $500,000 to the winner. In a sense these constitute the "Nobel Prizes of Engineering."
