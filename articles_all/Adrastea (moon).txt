'''Adrastea''' or ''''''.
Adrastea was the first moon to be found from images taken by an interplanetary spacecraft, rather than through telescopic photography.

 Physical characteristics 
Adrastea is non-Sphere|spherical and measures 20x16x14 km³ across. What Adrastea is made of and the mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea (~0.86 g/cm³) its mass can be estimated at ~2×1015 kg. Amalthea's density implies that moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10-15%, and Adrastea may be similar.

No surface details of Adrastea are known, due to the low resolution of available images.


 Orbit 
Adrastea is the smallest and second closest member of the closer moons to Jupiter. It orbits Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter at ~129,000&nbsp;km (1.806 Jupiter radii) within the planet's Rings of Jupiter#Main Ring|Main Ring. The orbital eccentricity of ~0.0015 and inclination of ~ 0.03° relative to the equator of Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter are very small.

 Exploration 
Adrastea was found in ''Voyager program|Voyager 1 and 2'' images, but appeared only as a dot. The Galileo spacecraft|''Galileo'' spacecraft was able to see its shape, but the images remain poor.
