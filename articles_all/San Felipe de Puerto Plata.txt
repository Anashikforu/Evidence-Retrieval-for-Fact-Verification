The Dominican Republic|Dominican city of '''San Felipe de Puerto Plata''', usually called just '''Puerto Plata''' is the head municipality of the Puerto Plata Province|Puerto Plata province, on the north (Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic) coast of the country.

Name
The name '''Puerto Plata''' ("Silver Port") came from the name given by Christopher Columbus|Columbus to the mountain just to the south of the city: ''Monte de Plata'' ("Silver Mountain") because the mountain always had clouds on its top and not because there was the metal silver; that mountain now is called '''Isabel de Torres''' mountain (in Spanish language|Spanish, the complete name is ''Loma Isabel de Torres''). Isabel de Torres was a lady who lived in Puerto Plata in 1605 and had a lot of land in the mountain.

The city was called first ''Puerto de Plata'' but later it was changed to just ''Puerto Plata'', the name that is still used

History

Columbus visited the Puerto Plata Bay on 11 January 1493. The city was founded and built by Nicolás de Ovando in 1502. Soon it became the most important port in the northern coast of the Hispaniola island and, in 1508, the king of Spain gave a coat of arms to the city.

Because there were many pirates and other Great Britain|British and France|French ships along the northern coast of the island, a fort was built here by orders of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos I, king of Spain; its construction took several years and it was finished in 1577. Because at that moment the Spanish's king was Phillip II of Spain|Felipe II, the fort was named '''Fuerte San Felipe''' (in English, ''Saint Phillip Fort'').

In 1606, those that were living in the towns of Puerto Plata and San Fernando de Monte Cristi|Monte Cristi were ordered by the Spanish king to move to the southeast of the island and to found a new town: Monte Plata. Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi were, then, destroyed. They were founded again in the 18th century with Family|families that came from the Canary Islands.
