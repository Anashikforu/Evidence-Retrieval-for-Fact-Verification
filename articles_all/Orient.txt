'''Orient''' is a term meaning "the east". It is from the Latin word ''oriens''. Ancient Rome sometimes used it to mean the area east of Rome. Later the dividing line moved farther east, to the Adriatic or the Aegean or the Indus River. This term is in contrast to the "Occident", which is a term meaning "the west".
