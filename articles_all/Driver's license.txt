 Laws controlling driver's licenses 
Different country|countries have different laws as to whether or not a person can have a driver's license. In some places, a person must pass a driving test before he or she is given a driver's license, while in other places, a driving license is given before the person starts driving.

In Victoria, Australia (for example), to get a driving licence a person must:
 be at least 18 years old
 live in Victoria
 pass an eye test
 pass a Hazard Perception Test (done on a computer)
 pass a practical Driving Test to show they can drive safely, control the car, follow road rules, and cooperate with other road users.

There are fees to be paid to do the driving tests, and if successful, there are more fees to be paid for the licence. Many people get a Learner's permit before getting a license. The first licence may be a Probationary Licence, which has certain restrictions on what a driver can do. After four years, the driver will qualify for a full, unrestricted licence.
