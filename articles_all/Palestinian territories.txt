The '''Palestinian territories''' usually refers to Judea and Samaria and the Gaza Strip. Their final status has yet to be determined. The territories were originally part of the Israeli Civil Administration, until the Oslo Accords in 1993. They were captured and occupied by Jordan and by Egypt in the late 1940s. Israel captured and occupied the areas in the Six-Day War in 1967.  Palestinian territories borders Jordan in the east, Israel in the west. It also borders Egypt on the southwest, which shares the maritime boundary of the Dead Sea.

After the Oslo Accords were signed in 1993, parts of the territories have been governed by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). Both Israel and the PNA claim East Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel in 1967. In 1980, Israel made a law to include East Jerusalem as part of Israel. This has not been recognized by any other country. Part of Judea and Samaria is ruled by the Israeli 'Judea and Samaria Civil Administration'. This has not been recognized by any other country.

Since the Palestinian Declaration of Independence in 1988, about 130 UN members have recognized the State of Palestine. Israel and the United States have not.
