A '''damage deposit''' or '''security''' '''deposit''' is a sum of money that is paid when one  renting|rents an item. It is paid to ensure the Ownership|owner that it is returned in good condition. It is very common with rented accommodation. There it may also be called a '''tenancy deposit''' or in some places a '''tenancy bond'''. Damage deposits can be either be refundable or nonrefundable, depending on the terms of the transaction. 

The owner of the item (the landlord in the case of accommodation) will take a sum of money from the person(s) renting the item (the tenant). If the item is returned in good condition at the end of the tenancy the owner should return the deposit. If the item is returned with damage the cost of repairing that damage may be charged against the deposit, and part (or none) of the deposit will be returned.

Security deposits are not considered taxable income, and local laws often treat security deposits as trust funds. Security deposits that are used as final rent payments must be claimed as advance rent and are taxable when paid.
