'''Pretty Good Privacy''' (PGP) is a computer program that provides Cryptography|cryptographic WP:PRIVACY|privacy and authentication. PGP is often used for Digital signature|signing, Encryption|encrypting and Decryption|decrypting electronic mails (e-mails) to increase the security of e-mail communications. It was originally created by Phil Zimmermann in 1991.

PGP and other similar products follow the '''OpenPGP''' standard (RFC 4880) for encrypting and decrypting data.

 OpenPGP 
OpenPGP is on the Internet Standard|Internet Standards Track; the current Specification (technical standard)|specification is RFC 4880 (November 2007). OpenPGP is still under development and the successor to RFC 2440, which is RFC 4880, has been made a proposed standard. Many e-mail clients provide ''OpenPGP-compliant'' email security as described in RFC 3156.

The Free Software Foundation has developed its own ''OpenPGP-compliant'' program called GNU Privacy Guard (Abbreviation|abbreviated GnuPG or GPG). GnuPG is freely available together with all source code under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and is maintained separately faraway from several Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) that interact with the GnuPG library for encryption, decryption and Digital signature|signing functions (see KGPG, Seahorse (software)|Seahorse, MacGPG). Several other vendors have also developed ''OpenPGP-compliant'' software.
