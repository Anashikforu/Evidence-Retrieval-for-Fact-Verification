The '''luna moth''' (''Actias luna'') is a species of moth. It is in the family (biology)|family Saturniidae. The luna moth is thought to be North America's most beautiful insect.David L. Wagner (2005). ''Caterpillars of Eastern North America.'' Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ. 

Description
The luna moth has a wingspan of 7.5 to 10.5&nbsp;cm. The wings are Lime (color)|lime-green. The bottom wings have long tails. There is a clear spot on each wing. There is a reddish-brown border on the top edge of the top wing. Some wikt:individual|individuals have pinkish wikt:border|borders on the outer edge of both wings. Other individuals have yellowish borders instead. Adult Luna Moths have no mouth at all, rendering them completely harmless.Charles V. Covell, Jr. 2005. ''Moths of Eastern North America.'' Virginia Museum of Natural History, Martinsville, VA. 

Distribution
The luna moth is found in North America. It is found from Nova Scotia, west to North Dakota, south to Texas, and east to Florida.

The luna moth is found in habitats such as woodlands and forests.

Life cycle

The luna moth's egg (biology)|eggs are brown. The caterpillar is green. It has bright red spots on its body. There are two yellow wikt:stripe|stripes that run down each side of the body. The caterpillar will grow to 6.5&nbsp;cm long. The luna moth caterpillar is similar to the polyphemus moth (''Antheraea polyphemus'') caterpillar. The polyphemus moth caterpillar does not have the yellow stripes on its body. The luna moth's cocoon is made of dead leaves on the ground. It hibernation|overwinters (spends the winter) as a cocoon. The luna moth has one brood (a brood is a group of offspring) each year in the northern part of its range. It has three broods each year in the southern part of its range.

 ''Alnus'' – Alder
 ''Betula'' – Birch
