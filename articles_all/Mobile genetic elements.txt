'''Mobile genetic elements''' (MGE) are a type of DNA that can move around within the genome. They include:
Transposons (also called transposable elements)
Transposon#Types|Retrotransposons
Transposon#Types|DNA transposons
Integrons
Insertion sequences
Plasmids
Bacteriophage elements, like Mu phage|Mu which integrates randomly into the genome
Intron|Group II introns
The total of all mobile genetic elements in a genome may be referred to as the '''mobilome'''.

Barbara McClintock was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for her discovery of mobile genetic elements".
