Fanfiction writers take fictional characters and fictional universe|settings from fictional (or sometimes history|historical) stories that were created by other people, and write original story|stories about them. People write fan fiction for many different book, television programme|television series, and movie fandoms.

When fanfiction first began, it was often only published in fan magazines. Today fanfiction, like many fandom activities, can be usually found on the internet. This has created many fanfiction communities. People in these communities post their fanfiction and receive feedback (reviews) from other community members.

There is also fan art (also called fanart), which is often drawings or other visual art based on a fandom.
