The '''Warsaw Uprising of 1794''' (also called the "Warsaw Insurrection") was started by a group of Poland|Polish people who lived in Warsaw. With help from the Poland|Polish Army, they tried to stop Russia from controlling the biggest city in Poland. It started on April 17, 1794, which was soon after Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko's victory at an important battle.

Although the Russian army was larger, had better weapons, and killed many Polish people, Russian soldiers started to lose a lot of land and suffered from many deaths.

The Polish people had been preparing to fight in the uprising since the spring of 1793.  A person who watched the fighting was a French artist, Jan Piotr Norblin, who drew pictures of the uprising.
