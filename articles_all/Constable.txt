A '''constable''' is a person doing a certain job, most commonly in Police|law enforcement.  The work and role of a constable can vary a lot in different countries.

Historically,  the word ''constable'' comes from the Latin,  ''comes  stabuli'', count of the stables. It came from the Eastern Roman Empire. Originally, the constable was the person who kept the horses of a lord or monarch.p103, Bruce, Alistair, ''Keepers of the Kingdom''  (Cassell, 2002), 
In modern times, constables are Police|law enforcement officers. In the United Kingdom,  Commonwealth of Nations and some European countries, a constable is the  lowest rank of police  officer. In the United States  a constable is usually an elected peace officer, with less powers than a sheriff. However, in the Channel Islands  a constable is an elected office-holder at the civil parish|parish level.

Historically, a  constable could also be someone in charge of the defence of a castle. Even today, there is a Constable of the Tower of London.

It is a similar position to Marshal, which comes from Old High German  ''marah'' "horse" and ''schalh''  "servant",  and originally meant "stable keeper",Jacob  und Wilhelm Grimm, Deutsches WÃ¶rterbuch, Leipzig 1854-1960, Vol. 12  Col. 1673
