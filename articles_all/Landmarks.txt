Originally, a '''landmark''' literally meant a prominent, easily identified geography|geographic point, (like a mountain, a cliff, or a river) used by exploration|explorers and others to find their way back or through an area.

In modern use, it includes anything that can be recognized easily, such as a monument, building, or other structure. In American English it is the main word used to call places that are tourist attractions because they are beautiful, or big, or they have historical importance. Some, such as National Landmarks, are on official lists of landmarks. Landmarks in the British English are normally used for casual navigation, such as giving directions to someone to get somewhere. This is done in American English as well.
