The British Rail '''Class 153''' "Sprinter (train)|Sprinter" is a single-car diesel multiple unit train.

In the early 1990s, British Rail took the decision that running 2-car trains on rural routes was inefficient, and identified the need for single-carriage trains.  Initially consideration was given to splitting the British Rail Class 156|Met-Cam Class 156 units to form class 152 units, however due to various problems with the British Rail Class 155|Class 155 units, the decision was taken to split these units instead.
