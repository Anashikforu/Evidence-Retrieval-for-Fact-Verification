The '''brown huntsman spider''' (''Heteropoda venatoria''), also known as the '''giant crab spider''' or the '''cane spider''', is a species of spider. found in many tropical and subtropical parts of the world, including Asia, RÃ©union Island, the Caribbean islands, the Southeastern US, and (especially) Australia.

Description
They have a flat type of body and only a small Dorsum (biology)|dorsal pattern. Adults can grow to be 2.2 to 2.8&nbsp;cm, and have a leg span of 7 to 12&nbsp;cm. Some have colors of brown, white and black.
Females have a larger abdomen than males but males have longer and thinner legs with a slim body. Both have a wide, yellow to cream clypeus band around the rest of the carapace.
Food
Brown huntsman spiders do not use spider webs to feed on prey. These spiders are known to hunt by waiting and making no noise above their prey, and then rush forward when their prey get close. They are fast, agile and can move through tight spaces. They feed at night.

If you let them into your home, they will eat unwanted bugs and insects like cockroaches and silverfish.
