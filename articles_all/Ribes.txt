'''''Ribes''''' is a genus of about 150 species of Angiosperms|flowering plants. They are native throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is the only genus in the family '''Grossulariaceae'''.  Seven subgenera are recognized.

Sometimes ''Ribes'' is instead put in the family Saxifragaceae. A few taxonomists place the gooseberry species in a separate genus of ''Grossularia''.

Cultivation
The genus ''Ribes'' includes the edible currants (blackcurrant, redcurrant, white currant), gooseberry, and several hybrid varieties. It should not be confused with the dried currant used in cakes and puddings, which is a cultivar of small grape (Zante currant). ''Ribes'' gives its name to the popular blackcurrant cordial Ribena.

The genus also includes the group of ornamental plants collectively known as the flowering currants, for instance ''Ribes sanguineum|R. sanguineum''.
