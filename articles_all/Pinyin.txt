'''Pinyin''' is the Mandarin language|Mandarin word for "spelling", writing letters showing the sound of a word in place of a Chinese character. Today, it almost always has the sense of '''Hanyu&nbsp;Pinyin''', the transliteration|way of writing Mandarin language|Mandarin sounds which has been used by the People's Republic of China from the 1950s. Other countries like the United States and Taiwan used other romanization of Chinese|ways of spelling Chinese (such as the Wade-Giles way) for a long time, but in the late 20th century started to use Hanyu&nbsp;Pinyin as well. It is the standard of China as well as the United Nations. It is the most common romanization system for Chinese.

Pinyin uses Roman letters in a special way for certain Chinese sounds. For example, the pinyin letter C is pronounced as /ts/ as in the English word "ca'''ts'''" or the Japanese word "'''ts'''unami", and does not sound at all like /k/ or /s/ by itself. Pinyin uses diacritic|special marks to show the four Chinese tone|Chinese tones, which are very important to using Mandarin clearly.
