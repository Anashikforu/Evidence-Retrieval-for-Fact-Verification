'''''Treponema pallidum''''' is a parasitic spirochaete bacterium.  There are different kinds of ''Treponema pallidum'', which cause diseases like syphilis, bejel, Pinta (disease)|pinta and yaws.

The most common disease caused by ''Treponema pallidum'' is syphilis, a serious sexually transmitted infection.  

Syphilis is treated and cured by taking antibiotics. Usually, the first treatment used is penicillin.

Pennicilin is still effective, but "the potential of this spirochete to develop additional antibiotic resistance could seriously compromise syphilis treatment and control".
