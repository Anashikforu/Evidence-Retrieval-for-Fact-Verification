'''Waka''' ( lit. "poem fragment").

These last three forms were no longer used at the beginning of the Heian Period, and ''ch≈çka'' also disappeared a short time after. So, the term ''waka'' came in time to mean the same as ''tanka''. Tanka is a much older form of Japanese poetry than haiku.

Waka did not follow any rules of rhyme, nor line; it was a free style kind of poetry. This can be seen in this example of tanka written by poet Yamanoue no Okura (660 - 733)
