A '''frying pan''', '''frypan''', or '''skillet''' is a cooking pan used for frying, searing, and Maillard reaction|browning foods. It is usually about 20 to 30&nbsp;cm (8 to 12&nbsp;inches) across. It is flat and has flared sides and no lid. It is almost always made of metal, such as iron or aluminum.

Frying pans also are often manufactured of some type of metal combination. Aluminium|Aluminum and stainless steel are favorite choices for this type of fryer tool. The metal pans are often coated with a copper bottom that adds both style and enhances the heat distribution qualities of the pan. However, a stainless steel or aluminum frying pan is not considered as versatile as the cast iron models, since they cannot be placed in the oven and are also not usually recommended with gas stovetops, since the flames tend to discolor and eventually damage the copper bottoms.

The first material used to manufacture the modern frying pan was copper; although there are evidences cast iron frying pans were also used during the Han dynasty|Han Dynasty.
