Life
Image:Brugge - Sint-Walburgakerk 3.jpg|thumb|left|Sint-Walburgakerk, built 1641, was the Jesuit church of Bruges.

Together with her brothers, Saint Willibald and Saint Winibald, she travelled to Francia (now Württemberg and Franconia) to help her uncle, Saint Boniface, in evangelizing among the Germans. She was educated by the nuns of Wimborne Minster (church)|Winborne Abbey, Dorset, where she spent twenty-six years. Thanks to her rigorous training, she was later able to write St. Winibald's ''biography'' and an account in Latin of St. Willibald's travels in Palestine. She is often credited with being the first female author of both England and Germany.A point made by

Walburga died on 25 February 777 or 779 and was buried at Heidenheim. In the 870s, her remains were brought to Eichstätt.

The earliest picture of Walpurga is from the early 11th century. It comes from the Hitda Codex, which was made in Cologne. It shows her holding stylized stalks of grain. The grain can be seen as an example of where a Christian saint (Walpurga) took over from an older pagan concept, in this case of the Corn Mother|Grain Mother.Pamela Berger, ''The Goddess Obscured: Transformation of the Grain Protectress from Goddess to Saint'',  1985:61-64, gives several examples and bibliographical notes.      

Walpurga is the patroness of Eichstätt, Antwerp, Oudenaarde, Veurne, Groningen (city)|Groningen, Zutphen and other towns in the Low Countries.
