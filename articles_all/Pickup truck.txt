A '''pickup truck''' is a type of vehicle that is designed to move things.

 Form 
The back of the truck is open, like some other types of trucks. It is very powerful for its small size. Pickup trucks have different shapes, sizes, and uses. Sometimes people would go ride in the back of the trucks to work. The back of the truck where the goods are placed is called a ''cargo bed''. The cargo bed may be covered with a ''tonneau cover'' made of Textile|cloth, metal or plastic, to protect the cargo from rain and dirt.

Pickup trucks are easy to load and unload. They are especially popular in the countryside, where they are used to carry various agriculture|agricultural cargo or Tool|tools.

Pickup trucks often have the same chassis as vans. Usually, pickup trucks are same size as normal cars. You usually may drive a pickup truck with the same driver's license as an ordinary car, but heavy pickup trucks may require a light truck license. The smallest pickup trucks are made from scooters by replacing the rear seat and rear wheel with an axle and cargo bed, and some have only three wheels.

A pickup truck can be turned into an improvised military vehicle by installing a machine gun or a light cannon on the cargo bed. Such cars are called "''technicals''", and they are especially popular in Africa.
