History
Despite it being very faint, Capricornus has one of the oldest mythological associations. It has consistently been represented as a mythological hybrid|cross of a goat and a fish since the Middle Bronze Age. The earliest picture of Capricornus is on a cylinder-seal dating c. 21st century BCE,.Master's Thesis of Peeter Espak, 2006 page 104 "
Because of the precession of the equinoxes the December solstice no longer takes place while the sun is in the constellation Capricornus. The astrological sign called Capricorn now begins with the solstice. The sun's most southerly position is now called the Tropic of Capricorn. This term also applies to the line on earth where the sun is directly overhead at noon on that solstice.

The planet Neptune was discovered in this constellation by German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle|Johann Galle, near Deneb Algedi (δ Capricorni) on September 23, 1846, which is reasonable as Capricornus can be seen best at 4:00am in September.

Mythology

Visualizations

Ptolemy's method of connecting the stars of Capricornus has been influential.
H. A. Rey has suggested an alternative way to join the stars, which graphically shows a goat. The goat's head is formed by the triangle of stars Iota Capricorni|ι Cap, Theta Capricorni|θ Cap, and Zeta Capricorni|ζ Cap.  The goat's horn sticks out with stars Gamma Capricorni|γ Cap and Delta Capricorni|δ Cap.  Star δ Cap, at the tip of the horn, is of the third magnitude. The goat's tail consists of stars Beta Capricorni|β Cap and Alpha Capricorni|α2 Cap: star β Cap being of the third magnitude. The goat's hind foot consists of stars Psi Capricorni|ψ Cap and Omega Capricorni|ω Cap.  Both of these stars are of the fourth magnitude.
