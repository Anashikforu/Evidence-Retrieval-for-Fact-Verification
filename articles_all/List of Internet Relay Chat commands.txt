<!-- ATTENTION EDITORS:
Do NOT include service-specific commands on this list. THEY WILL BE REMOVED.

This is a list of all '''Internet Relay Chat commands''' from IETF Request for Comments|RFCs 1459 and 2812. Most IRC clients need commands to have a slash ("/") before the command. Angle brackets ("") mean what's placed in the secondary field, not a literal part of the command. Settings encapsulated in square brackets ("" and "") are optional and override the command's defaults.
