'''Homininae''' is a subfamily of Hominidae, which includes humans, gorillas, and chimpanzees which are native to Africa.

Most importantly, it also includes extinct human relatives such as Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, and earlier species of the genus ''Homo''. It includes all those hominid species which arose after the split from the other great apes.
