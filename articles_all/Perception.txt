In psychology and the cognitive sciences, '''perception''' is the process of taking in, picking, organizing, and understanding sense|sensory information.The word ''perception'' comes from the Latin ''perception-, percepio'' and means "receiving, collecting, action of taking possession, apprehension with the mind or senses."—OED.com. It includes collecting data from sense organs and interpreting it in the brain. Consider this: Light enters our eyes, and the brain works on this information to build up a mental picture of what is going on "out there". Perception is a lot more than just "information coming in". It is an ''active'' process.

There are many ways to study perception. There are  biology|biological or physiology|physiological approaches, psychology|psychological approaches through the philosophy of mind and experiments. There are studies by philosophers such as David Hume, John Locke, George Berkeley.

 History of the study of perception 
The study of perception started with the study of sight. This makes sense because humans understand the world largely by looking at it. 

= Ancient Greece =
The first studies of perception happened in the years 460-371 Anno Domini|BC by the Greece|Greek Philosophy|philosopher Democritus. He believed the shapes we see were pictures which flew to our eyes, where our soul would then recognize them. The philosopher Plato (427- 348 Anno Domini|BC) later came up with a new idea, he believed the eyes worked by first making light and then scanning the world. Another Greek philosopher and student of Plato called Aristotle (384 to 322 BC) did not agree with these ideas. He presented a new theory : 

 Light can only come from bright objects, like fire and the sun.
 Light is not something you can touch
 Light hits objects and then bounces off the object to hit our eyes
 Light moves through something that humans can't see

Aristotle's ideas were accepted for hundreds of years to follow. 

= 10th & 11th Century =
Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham wrote the first Mathematics|mathematical description of the visual process 

= 17th Century =
Johannes Kepler|Kepler explained what is inside of the eye. René Descartes|Descartes said that the way our Senses|physical senses see the world does not affect how we think about the world. John Locke|Locke and René Descartes|Descartes both thought humans saw color because of the senses.

= 18th Century =
Immanuel Kant|Kant suggested that humans can't know about things which our senses don’t see. Because of this he stated that a god and a soul were not possible. 

= 19th Century =
New techniques were created and used to study the brain and perception. Many of these studies were paired with Database|data on Behaviour|human behavior. The psychologist Wilhelm Wundt|Wundt stated that perception could not just be explained by the way the body works and that psychology was needed too.

= 20th Century =
Gestalt psychology was formed. The idea behind this group of thinkers was that perception is more than the sum of our senses. 

 Process of Perception 

= Bruner's model of perception =
# When we see someone we don't know, we are looking for signs which will tell us things about them.
# As we pick up on some signs, we match this person to a group we have seen before. 
# The search for signs that tell us about who they are becomes less broad.
# We now only search for signs that put this person into the group we have matched them to. 

= Saks and Johns model of perception =
# ''The perceiver'' : This is the person doing the observing and perceiving. There are three things that can have an effect on someone's perception. These are : How much experience someone has, how Motivation|motivated this person is, and how they are feeling. Also, in some situations someone can use a "'''perceptual defense'''", this is when they only see what they want to see.
# ''The person who is being watched and perceived'' : The least the other person knows about them the more they will try to guess.
# ''The time and place this situation is happening at'' : This affects the amount of attention the perceiver gives to a situation. 

 Types of perception 
= Vision =
Vision is what you see. Seeing something happens when light enters the eyes. This light is turned into an Electric current|electric message which travels to the brain and gets turned into a picture.

= Sound =
Sound is what you hear. The ears catch movement from Sound|sound waves which move in every direction. The brain takes these in, creating what we hear. 

= Touch =
Touch is what you feel with your skin. The skin's top layer has Receptor (cell biology)|receptors that take information in when touched. These Receptor (cell biology)|receptors can sense pain, how hot or cold something is and how heavy something is. Receptors then send this information to our nervous system. 

= Taste =
Taste is the flavor of things we eat or drink. Our tongue has many little bumps which take in our food's flavor. These bumps then send a message to our brain for us to taste.

= Smell =
The skin inside your nose has small Cell|cells which send messages to your brain when you breathe in. Your brain then senses the smell.

 Theories of Perception 
Theories of perception can be sorted into two groups. The first group believes in '''Bottom-Up processing'''. This approach means that to perceive, humans only needs information from their senses. For example : light enters the eye, this light is sent to the brain and the brain turns it into something we see. 

The second group is '''Top-Down processing'''. In this approach, perception starts off with something general and becomes specific. What we already know or expect has a big effect here. For example : if you see half of a cat, you will have an idea of what it looks like even though half of it is hidden. This is because you have seen a cat before. Top down processing helps humans quickly make sense of their environment without having to think too much. 

= Bottom-up processing =

 Gibson's Ecological Theory 
:en:James_J._Gibson|James Gibson (1904-1979) states that perception happens because of our human instincts. This means it can't be learned. He suggests that perception is needed for humans to stay alive. Neanderthal|Neanderthals would have needed perception to escape danger, suggesting perception is the result of evolution. Gibson's theory is known as the "''Ecological Theory''" , because he says that perception can only be explained by our environment. To Gibson, Sensation Equals sign|= perception.
