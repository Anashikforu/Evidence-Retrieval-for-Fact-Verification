 
'''Upper Egypt''' is a narrow strip of land on both sides of the  Nile that extends from modern-day Aswan to the area south of modern-day Cairo. The northern part of Upper Egypt, between El-Aiyat and Asyut is sometimes called Middle Egypt.

Upper Egypt was known as ''Ta Shemau'' Ermann & Grapow, ''op.cit.'' Wb 5, 227.4-14 which means "the land of reeds."Ermann & Grapow, ''op.cit.'' Wb 4, 477.9-11 It was divided into twenty-two districts called Nome (Egypt)|nomes.''The Encyclopedia Americana'', p.34 The first nome was roughly where modern Aswan is and the twenty-second was at modern Atfih (Atfih|Aphroditopolis), just to the south of Cairo.

For most of pharaonic Egypt's history Thebes, Egypt|Thebes was the administrative centre of Upper Egypt. Under the Ptolemies the city of Ptolemais took over the role of capital of Upper Egypt. ''See:'' Chauveau, ''op.cit.'', p.68

Upper Egypt was represented by the tall White Crown ''Hedjet'', and its symbol was the flowering Nelumbo|lotus.

It is in this region that the Arab Bedouin were installed before settling between Tunisia and eastern Algeria (Constantinois)
