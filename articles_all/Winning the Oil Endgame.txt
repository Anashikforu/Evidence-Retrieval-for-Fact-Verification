'''''Winning the Oil Endgame''''' is a 2005 book by Amory B. Lovins,  published by the Rocky Mountain Institute.  It talks about four ways to reduce petroleum|oil (petroleum) dependence in the United States:
Using oil more efficiently (pp.&nbsp;29–102).
Substituting other liquids for oil (pp.&nbsp;103–111).
Substituting saved natural gas for oil (pp.&nbsp;111–122).
Replacing oil with hydrogen (pp.&nbsp;228–242).

Problems and solutions

The authors suggest that oil dependence is a problem we need no longer have. U.S. oil dependence can be profitably eliminated by proven and attractive technologies. The authors argue that America can lead the world into the post-petroleum era and create a vibrant economy. (p.xiii)
