 Servers 


 Obsolete Servers 
The following servers are no longer maintained, but basic details are maintained for posterity. They will not be listed in feature comparison tables.



 Operating system support 
The operating systems that the daemon is compatible with.


 Technology 
Various Computer network|networking and IRC technology used to date.


 Features 
IRC server features, mostly extensions to RFC 1459. Probably also implementations of RFC 2810, RFC 2811, RFC 2812, RFC 2813, and possibly IRCX.

 +channels (In early IRCds, these were simply named channels. At least one modern IRCd (IRCD) uses the + prefix for modeless channels, i.e. no chanops and channel mode forced to +nt. This is described in RFC 2811.)
 #channels ("+channels" were later replaced with "#channels" in version 2.7, numeric channels were removed entirely and channel bans (mode +b) were implemented.)
 &channels (irc2.8, those that exist only on the current server, rather than the entire network)
 !channels (irc2.10, those that are theoretically safe from suffering from the many ways that a user could exploit a channel by "riding a netsplit"; IRCds using timestamping provide (most of) this functionality on #channels)
 %#channels (#channels whose name are in UTF-8 for IRCX)
 %&channels (&channels whose name are in UTF-8 for IRCX)
 %!channels (!channels whose name are in UTF-8 for IRCX)
