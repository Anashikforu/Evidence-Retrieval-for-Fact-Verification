The '''Israeli–Palestinian conflict''' is a war and dispute that is still going on between the Israel|State of Israel and the Palestinian people|Palestinians (some of which are represented by the Palestinian Authority, Fatah, or Hamas). It is part of the wider Arab–Israeli conflict. The dispute is over a specific area of land (what used to be the Mandatory Palestine area) that Palestinians and Israelis both claim. Many attempts have been made to make a two-state solution, which would mean an independent Proposals for a Palestinian state|Palestinian state and an Israeli state, dividing the land between the two groups.Right now, the vast majority of Israelis and Jews, according to many polls, agree a two-state solution is the best way to end the conflict."The latest survey, conducted in March, covered a representative sample of over 4,000 people in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Charlie and lola and the United Arab Emirates (1.6 percent margin of error) ... A majority of Arabs continues to support the two-state solution based on the 1967 borders, though an increasing majority is pessimistic about its prospects.." ''Haaretz.com''. By Prof. Ephraim Yaar and Prof. Tamar Hermann. Published 11/12/2007.
On top of that, a majority of the common Jewish people see the Palestinians' demand for an independent state as just, and thinks Israel can agree to the creationof such a state. Most Palestinians view Judea and Samaria and the Gaza Strip as the area of their future state, which is a view also accepted by most Israelis.Alan Dershowitz|Dershowitz, Alan. ''The Case for Peace: How the Arab-Israeli Conflict Can Be Resolved''. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2005 A handful of academics advocate a one-state solution, where all of Israel, the Gaza Strip, and Judea and Samaria would become a bi-national state (a country for both Israelis and Palestinians) with equal rights for all.The source of the Jewish public's skepticism - and even pessimism - is apparently the widespread belief that a peace agreement based on the "two states for two peoples" formula would not lead the Palestinians to end their conflict with Israel.

In 1920, 1937, 1948, 1967, 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2021 there were agreements to split the land into two countries, away from the original plan of a Jewish state in all of mandatory Palestine (Jordan and Israel). Israel accepted all of them. Every other plan has been rejected by most factions of Arabs or Palestinians.

Because of the very existance of the Republic of the State of Israel it is an objective of hatred from Arab, African and Asian Countries. Many Jewish Communites in those regions no longer exist and have gone up to Israel.

In 1948, there were between 758,000 and 881,000 Jews (see table below) living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 24,000. In some Arab states, such as Libya, which was about 3% Jewish, the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain.Of the chart showing rements of Jews in Muslin Countries the following updates of their status  of Jewish Population 2020: {other counties on chart as of 2020 Jewish Population is not listed
