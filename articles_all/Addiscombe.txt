'''Addiscombe''' is a area in Croydon, in the London Borough of Croydon, England. Three hundred years ago, Addiscombe was a rural area. The area was mainly used for farming and brick-making. There used to be a railway that went through Addiscombe, but in 2000, it was changed to tramlink tracks and a new stop was built.
