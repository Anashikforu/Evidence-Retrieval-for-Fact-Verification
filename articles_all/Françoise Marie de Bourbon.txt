Biography

Originally known as the second ''Mademoiselle de Blois'', that style eventually gave way to the name ''Françoise Marie de Blois''. She married her first cousin Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d'Orléans in 18 February 1692 at the age of fourteen and later bore eight children, four of which would have further children.

Proud, lazy and attractive, she successfully intrigued to have her daughters marry well to the Louis François, Prince of Conti|Prince of Conti, Charles, Duke of Berry (1686–1714)|Duke of Berry, Duke of Modena and Louis I of Spain|King of Spain, mostly to spite her sister Louise Françoise de Bourbon, the Duchess of Bourbon. However, she welded little political influence considering her proximity to the political circle of the era. She was involved in the Cellamare Conspiracy in 1718 which was supposed to overthrow her own husband Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d'Orléans as Régence|Regent of the Kingdom and replace him with her favourite brother the Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine|Duke of Maine. The ''Marc-René de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson (1652–1721)|marquis d'Argenson'' said she was very like her mother, Madame de Montespan, but also had Louis XIV's orderly mind with his failings of injustice and harshness.

Among her patrilineality|male line descendents are Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe Egalité, Louis-Philippe I, King of the French, and Prince Henri, Count of Paris, Duke of France|Prince Henri, Count of Paris, the present Orléanist pretender to the French throne. She is also an ancestor of Juan Carlos I of Spain, Philippe of Belgium|Philippe, King of the Belgians, Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg and Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples, the pretender to the Italian throne.
