'''Manna''', sometimes spelled '''mana''', is the name of a food which, according to the Pentateuch of the Bible, the Israelites ate while they were traveling 40 years in the desert after leaving Egypt, which God provided because they had nothing to eat.

Where did they come from?
Manna was called the "bread of heaven" because it seemed to come from Heaven, according to the Bible. Some suggest that they were a type of locust; some say that it was the sap of a tree which is known to wikt:satisfy|satisfy hunger. In the Mishna, it is said that it was made during twilight of the sixth day of Creation.
