'''Kayastha''' is one of the social groups of India. They have a long history. They number around 5â€“7 million people and most of them live in India.

Hindus believe that Brahma|Lord Brahma created the world. He then created 16 sons from different parts of his body. His 17th son, Shree Chitraguptjee, was created from his mind and soul. He is the only son to be made from the whole body, not just parts. In human form he is called ''kayastha'', ''kaya'' meaning whole. Kayastha's have two roles in the caste system, as Kshatriya (a warrior) and Brahmin (a learned person or scribe). The Kayastha caste is divided into 12 sub-castes.
