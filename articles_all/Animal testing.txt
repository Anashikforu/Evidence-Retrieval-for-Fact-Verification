'''Animal testing''', also known as '''animal experimentation''' and '''animal research''' is the use of animals for experiments. Escherichia coli, Drosophila melanogaster|Fruit flies, and mice are often used for animal testing. About 50 to 100 million vertebrate animals and many more invertebrate animals are used around the world every year.
Animals are used for experiments inside university|universities, medical schools, farms, large company|companies and other places that provide animal-testing services. People who support animal testing argue that almost every medical discovery in the 20th century used animals in some way.
 Definitions 

The words animal testing, '''animal experimentation''', animal research, '''''in vitro'' testing''', and '''vivisection''' have similar meanings,differently. "tatiosion" means to "cut up" a living animal. It was used only in experiments that dissection|dissected live animals. The word "vivisection" is sometimes used wikt:negative|negatively about any experiment with live animals. For example, the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' described "vivisection" as: "Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals".

The earliest mention of animal testing is in the writings of the Ancient Greece|Greeks in the second and fourth centuries BCE. Aristotle (Αριστοτέλης) (384 – 322 BCE) and Erasistratus (304 – 258 BCE) where some of the first people to try out experiments on living animals.Cohen and Loew 1984. Galen, a doctor in second-century Ancient Rome|Rome who was known as the "father of vivisection", dissected pigs and goats.
Animals have often been used in the history of scientific study. In the 1880s, Louis Pasteur showed the Germ theory of disease|germ theory of medicine by putting Anthrax (disease)|anthrax in sheep. In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning. In the 1970s, antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were made using armadillos, In 1974, Rudolf Jaenisch produced the first genetically changed mammal. He put DNA from a virus into the genome of mice.Jaenisch R, Mintz B (1974) 
In the 20th century, toxicology testing became important. In the 19th century, laws about drugs were less strict. Drugs did not have to be checked for safety. But in 1937, a drug called Elixir Sulfanilamide  killed more than 100 people. They caused great and long lasting pain, vomiting, and fits. After that, the U.S. congress made laws that said that drugs had to be tested on animals before they could be sold. Other countries passed similar laws.

Even back in the 17th century, people disagreed about animal testing. In 1655, Edmund O'Meara said that "the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state."Ryder, Richard D. Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism. Berg Publishers, 2000, p. 54.
Supporters had different views. They argued that experiments on animals were necessary for knowledge. Claude Bernard, the "prince of vivisectors"Croce, Pietro. ''Vivisection or Science? An Investigation into Testing Drugs and Safeguarding Health''. Zed Books, 1999, p. 11. and the father of physiology famously wrote in 1865 that "the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly (brightly) lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen".
In 1896, Walter Cannon|Dr. Walter B. Cannon said, “The antivivisectionists are the second of the two types Theodore Roosevelt described when he said, ‘Common sense without wikt:conscience|conscience may lead to crime, but conscience without common sense may lead to wikt:folly|folly, which is the handmaiden (servant) of crime.’ ”
