An '''electronic component''' is a basic electronics|electronic element. These components can be connected together to make Electrical circuit|circuits. Components can be single items (resistor, transistor) or in more or less complex groups as integrated circuits (logic gate, resistor array).

List of electronic components
=Wire=

A thin metal conductor

=Cable=

A flexible conducting electrical or optical link.
 '''cable connector''': connector at either end of a cable.
 '''cable matcher''': an impedance matching device that allows non-standard cable to be used with a particular device.
 '''cable plant''' = all the cables, connectors and patch panels within a building or office.
 '''cabling''' = cable as a material.
 '''co-axial cable''' = Such cables are usually made of a conducting wire. Then there is some insulation, then there is another layer of conducting material. Finally there is the (insulating) mantle. Such cables are used as a transmission line#High-frequency electrical transmission lines|high-frequency transmission line to carry a high-frequency or broadband signal. Because the electromagnetic field carrying the signal exists (ideally) only in the space between the inner and outer electrical conductor|conductors, it cannot interfere with or suffer interference from external electromagnetic fields.
 '''ribbon cable''' = A flat, thin cable containing many parallel wires. Because of their shape, ribbon cables are ideal for situations where space needs to be conserved. They're used, for example, within a computer chassis to connect disk drives to the disk drive controllers.
 '''type cable''' = a specification for cable defined by IBM.

=Connector=

A physical device with a number of metal contacts that allow devices to be easily linked together.
 '''connector plug''' = a device at the end of a fibre-optic or copper cable that receives and contains something.

=Switch=

A mechanical or hard state device that can electrically connect or isolate two or more lines.
