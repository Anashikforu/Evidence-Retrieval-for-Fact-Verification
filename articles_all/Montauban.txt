History

Together with Mont-de-Marsan, Montauban is one of the oldest towns with walls (a bastide) in southern France. It was founded in 1144 by Alphonse Jourdain, Count of Toulouse. Most of the inhabitants came from Montauriol, a village which had grown up around the neighbouring monastery of Theodard of Narbonne|St Théodard.

In the 13th century the town suffered much during the Albigensian Crusade and from the Inquisition, but by 1317 it had recovered sufficiently to be chosen by the Pope John XXII as the head of a diocese of which the basilica of St Théodard became the cathedral.

In 1360, under the Treaty of Brétigny, the town was given to the English people|English; they were expelled by the inhabitants in 1414. In 1560 the bishops became Protestantism|Protestants; ten years later it became one of the four Huguenot strongholds under the Peace of Saint-Germain, and formed a small independent republic.

In 1790, Montauban was in the Lot (department)|Lot department as the capital of a district; with the creation of the ''arrondissements'' in 1800, Montauban became a Prefectures in France|''sous-préfecture'' in the Lot department. When Napoleon created the Tarn-et-Garonne department in 1809, Montauban became the préfecture (capital) of the new department.
