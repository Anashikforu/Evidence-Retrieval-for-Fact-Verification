'''Slipknot (band)|Slipknot''' is a heavy metal music|heavy metal band from Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines, Iowa. The band started in 1995 by singer|vocalist and percussionist Anders Colsefini, guitarists Donnie Steele and Josh "Gnar" Brainard, bass guitar|bassist Paul Gray (Slipknot)|Paul Gray, drummer Joey Jordison,and percussionist Shawn Crahan. Before the band released its first album in 1999, Slipknot has gone through many line-up changes. After their first album, the line-up has stayed the same. The band is known for having a lot of members. The current members include a lead singer, two guitarists, a bassist, a drummer, two percussionists, a Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler, and a Turntablism|turntablist.

In 1996, when the band finished recording their demo album ''Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.'', Slipknot saw its first line-up change when guitarist Donnie Steele left the band and was replaced by Craig Jones. Shortly after, drummer Jordison said they needed a full-time sampler and Jones took the position as "he liked doing that anyway." Mick Thomson then joined the band to be the new guitarist. After ''Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.'' was released, the band were working on new songs which needed more singing melody and the then-lead singer Colsefini had a hard time with this. Because of that, Colsefini was moved to backing vocals and percussion. However Colsefini was unhappy with his new role and left the band a month later.

Since the band wanted to keep their percussive sound, Greg Welts joined the band to replace Colsefini. Towards the end of 1997, each band member picked an a number to identify themselves. Sid Wilson approached the band after seeing them live. He proceeded to impress the band with his ability and his antics; Wilson was considered "Slipknot material" and his hiring brought the band's line-up to nine members. The final change in the band's line-up came at the latter stages of the recording process of the band's debut album, ''Slipknot'', in 1999. While the band took a break from recording the album, Brainard decided to leave the band and was replaced by James Root|Jim Root.

Two more lineup changes took place over the years. The first was after the departure of Joey Jordison in December 2013. In early 2014, the late Paul Gray was replaced by Alessandro Venturella, and Jordison was replaced by Jay Weinberg, leaving Crahan as the only remaining original member. The second change occurred in mid 2019, after Chris Fehn was fired from the band. He was replaced by a mysterious new member.
