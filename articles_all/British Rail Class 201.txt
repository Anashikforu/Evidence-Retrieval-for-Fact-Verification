The British Rail '''Class 201''' (or SR Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification#Diesel Electric Multiple Units|6S) six-car diesel-electric multiple units (DEMUs) were built in 1957â€“1958 at Eastleigh railway works and Ashford, Kent|Ashford railway works. They were built for use on the London to Hastings line. Several tunnels along the route had restricted clearance, meaning that these units were built with a narrow body profile.
