The '''bow''' is the forward part of the  Hull (watercraft)|hull of a ship or boat, the point that is most forward when the vessel is underway. 
The bow is designed to reduce the resistance of the hull cutting through water and should be tall enough to prevent water from easily washing over the top of it. The bow is helpful for letting the ship smoothly pass through the ocean.
