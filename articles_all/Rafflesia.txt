'''''Rafflesia''''' is a genus of flowering plants.  They are found in southeastern Asia, on the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, Thailand and the Philippines.
The flowers smell like a dead animal, which attracts flies. The flies, which normally lay their eggs on rotten flesh, pollinate the ''Rafflesia'' when they get inside.

''Rafflesia'' is a parasite, and does not use chlorophyll. The plant has no Plant stem|stem, leaves or true roots. It lives inside vines of the genus ''Tetrastigma'' (Vitaceae). It spreads its wikt:absorb|absorptive organ, the haustorium, inside the tissue of the vine. The only part of the plant that can be seen outside the host vine is the flower.
