'''Scientific notation''' is a way of writing numbers that is often used by scientists and mathematicians to make it easier to write large and small numbers. A number that is written in scientific notation has several properties that make it very useful to local scientists. It makes very large numbers into smaller numbers using decimals and exponents.

 Variations 
The basic idea of scientific notation is to express zeros as a Exponentiation|power of ten. The notation for this can be written as :
a\,\times\,10^b\!
where ''b'' is an integer, or "whole" number, that describes the number of times 10 is multiplied by itself and the letter ''a'' any real number, called the significand or mantissa (''using "mantissa" may cause confusion as it can also refer to the vulgar fraction|fractional part of the common logarithm'').

= Normalized notation =
Written in the form . There is no need to represent zero in normalized form, the digit 0 is sufficient. The normalized form allows easy comparison of two numbers of the same sign in ''a'', as the exponent ''b'' gives the number's order of magnitude.
