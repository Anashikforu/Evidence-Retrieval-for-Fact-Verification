'''Nazi Germany''' started a strong '''anti-tobacco movement'''  In 1940, German scientists found a link between smoking tobacco, and lung cancer. 

Anti-tobacco movements grew in many countries from the beginning of the 20th century. But all these had little success. The only exception was Germany where it was supported by the government after the Nazis came to power.

The Nazi anti-tobacco campaign used many methods like restrictions on smoking in public spaces, limiting tobacco advertising, restrictions on tobacco rations for women, restrictions on restaurants and coffeehouses, promoting health education, This anti-smoking campaign was more powerful and serious than the anti-tobacco movement in Germany at the beginning of the 21st century.

Prelude to Nazi anti-tobacco campaign

Anti-tobacco thoughts existed in Germany in the early 1900s. People who disliked smoking formed the first anti-tobacco group in the country named the ''Deutscher Tabakgegnerverein zum Schutze der Nichtraucher'' (German Tobacco Opponents' Association for the Protection of Non-smokers). Established in 1904, this organization existed for a brief period only. The next anti-tobacco organization, the ''Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner'' (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents), was established in 1910 in Trautenau, Bohemia. Other anti-smoking organizations were established in 1912 in the cities of Hanover and Dresden. In 1920, a ''Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in der Tschechoslowakei'' (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents in Czechoslovakia) was formed in Prague, after Czechoslovakia was separated from Austria at the end of World War I. A ''Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in Deutschösterreich'' (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents in Austria) was established in Graz in 1920.

These groups published journals advocating nonsmoking. The first such German language journal was ''Der Tabakgegner'' (The Tobacco Opponent), published by the Bohemian organization between 1912 and 1932. The ''Deutsche Tabakgegner'' (German Tobacco Opponents) was published in Dresden from 1919 to 1935, and was the second journal on this issue.

Hitler's attitude towards smoking

Adolf Hitler was a heavy smoker in his early life, smoking 25 to 40 cigarettes daily. He gave up when he realized it was a waste of money. In later years, Hitler viewed smoking as "decadent" (meaning that it was bad for his health) and "the wrath of the Native Americans in the United States|Red Man against the White Man, vengeance for having been given hard liquor". He was sad that "so many excellent men have been lost to tobacco poisoning".

Hitler disapproved of the military personnel's freedom to smoke, and during World War II he said on March 2, 1942, "it was a mistake, traceable to the army leadership at the time, at the beginning of the war". He also said that it was "not correct to say that a soldier cannot live without smoking". He promised to end the use of tobacco in the military after the end of the war. Hitler personally encouraged close friends not to smoke and rewarded those who Tobacco smoking|quit smoking. However, Hitler's dislike for tobacco was only one of several reasons behind the anti-smoking campaign.

Reproductive policies
The Nazi Nazi Germany#Women's rights|reproductive policies were an important factor behind their anti-tobacco campaign. Women who smoked were considered to be more likely to age wikt:premature|prematurely, and lose physical attractiveness; they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family. Werner Huttig of the Nazi Party's ''Office of Racial Policy|Rassenpolitisches Amt'' (Office of Racial Politics) claimed smoking mothers' Breastfeeding|breast milk contained nicotine.

Research
Research and studies on tobacco's effects on the population's health were more advanced in Germany than in any other nation by the time the Nazis came to power. The Lung cancer#Smoking|link between lung cancer and tobacco was first proved in Nazi Germany, Established in 1941, it was the most significant anti-tobacco institute in Nazi Germany.

Franz H. Müller in 1939 and E. Schairer in 1943 first used case-control epidemiological methods to study lung cancer among smokers. In 1939, Müller published a study report in a reputed cancer journal in Germany claiming that prevalence of lung cancer was higher among smokers. Müller, described as the "forgotten father of experimental epidemiology",

Physicians in the Third Reich were aware that smoking is responsible for Cardiovascular disease|cardiac diseases, which were considered to be the most serious diseases resulting from smoking. The use of nicotine was sometimes considered to be responsible for increased reports of myocardial infarction in the country. In the later years of World War II, researchers considered nicotine a factor behind the coronary heart failures suffered by a significant number of military personnel in the Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front. A pathologist of the Heer (1935-1945)|Heer examined thirty-two young soldiers who had died from myocardial infarction at the front, and documented in a 1944 report that all of them were "enthusiastic smokers". He cited the opinion of pathologist Franz Buchner that cigarettes are "a coronary poison of the first order."

Anti-tobacco measures
The Nazis used several public relations tactics to convince the general population of Germany not to smoke. Well-known health magazines like the ''Gesundes Volk'' (Healthy People), ''Volksgesundheit'' (People's Health) and ''Gesundes Leben'' (Healthy Life) Out of these magazines, ''Reine Luft'' was the main journal of the Nazi anti-tobacco movement.

After recognizing the harmful effects of smoking on health, several items of anti-smoking legislation were enacted. Smoking was also outlawed in schools.

In 1941, tobacco smoking in trams was outlawed in sixty German cities. Smoking was also outlawed in bomb shelters; however, some shelters had separate rooms for smoking. Special care was taken to prevent women from smoking. The President of the Medical Association in Germany announced, "German women don't smoke". The next step in the anti-tobacco campaign came in July 1943, when public smoking for persons under the age of 18 was outlawed. In the next year, smoking in buses and city trains was made illegal, on the personal initiative of Hitler, who feared female ticket takers might be the victims of passive smoking.

Restrictions were imposed on the advertisement of tobacco products,

Restrictions on smoking were also introduced in the Wehrmacht. Cigarette rations in the military were limited to six per soldier per day. Extra cigarettes were often sold to the soldiers, especially when there was no military advance or retreat in the battleground, however, these were restricted to 50 for each person per month. Access to cigarettes was not allowed for the Wehrmacht's female auxiliary personnel. Medical lectures were arranged to persuade military personnel to quit smoking. An ordinance enacted on November 3, 1941, raised tobacco taxes by approximately 80–95% of the retail price. It would be the highest rise in tobacco taxes in Germany for more than 25 years after the Nazi Germany#Capitulation of German forces|collapse of the Nazi regime.

Effectiveness
The early anti-smoking campaign was thought to be a failure, and from 1933 to 1937 there was a rapid increase in tobacco consumption in Germany. The rate of smoking in the nation increased faster even than in neighboring France, where the anti-tobacco movement was tiny and far less influential. Between 1932 and 1939, per capita cigarette consumption in Germany increased from 570 to 900 per year, while the corresponding numbers for France were from 570 to 630.

The cigarette manufacturing companies in Germany made several attempts to weaken the anti-tobacco campaign. They made new journals and tried to show the anti-tobacco movement as "fanatic" and "unscientific". The tobacco industry also tried to counter the Nazi Germany#Government|government campaign to prevent women from smoking and used smoking models in their advertisements. Despite government regulations, many women in Germany regularly smoked, including the wives of many high-ranking Nazi officials. For instance, Magda Goebbels smoked even while she was interviewed by a journalist. Fashion illustrations displaying women with cigarettes were often published in prominent publications such as the ''Beyers Mode für Alle'' (Beyers Fashion For All). The cover of the popular song ''Lili Marleen'' featured singer Lale Andersen holding a cigarette.

The Nazis implemented more anti-tobacco policies at the end of the 1930s and by the early years of World War II, the rate of tobacco usage declined. As a result of the anti-tobacco measures implemented in the Wehrmacht, the total tobacco consumption by soldiers decreased between 1939 and 1945. According to a survey conducted in 1944, the number of smokers increased in the Wehrmacht, but average tobacco consumption per military personnel declined by 23.4% compared to the immediate pre-World War II years. The number of people who smoked 30 or more cigarettes per day declined from 4.4% to 0.3%.



The Nazi anti-tobacco policies were not exempt of contradictions. For example, the ''Volksgesundheit'' (People's Health) and ''Gesundheitspflicht'' (Duty to be Healthy) policies were enforced in parallel with the active distribution of cigarettes to people who the Nazis saw "deserving" groups (e.g. frontline soldiers, members of the Hitler Youth). "Undeserving" and stigmatized groups (Jews, war prisoners), however, were denied access to tobacco.

Association with antisemitism and racism
Apart from public health concerns, the Nazis were heavily influenced by ideology; specifically, the movement was influenced by concepts of racial hygiene and bodily purity. Nazi anti-tobacco activists often tried to depict tobacco as a "vice" of the "degenerate" Africans.

the Nazis claimed that the Jews were responsible for introducing tobacco and its harmful effects. The Seventh-day Adventist Church in Germany announced that smoking was an unhealthy vice spread by the Jews. Johann von Leers, editor of the ''Nordische Welt'' (Nordic World), during the opening ceremony of the ''Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren'' in 1941, proclaimed that "Jewish capitalism" was responsible for the spread of tobacco use across Europe. He said that the first tobacco on German soil was brought by the Jews and that they controlled the tobacco industry in Amsterdam, the principal European entry point of ''Nicotiana''.

After World War II

After the collapse of Nazi Germany at the end of World War II, American cigarette manufacturers quickly entered the German market. Illegal smuggling of tobacco became prevalent, and leaders of the Nazi anti-smoking campaign were silenced. In 1949, approximately 400&nbsp; million cigarettes manufactured in the United States entered Germany illegally every month. In 1954, nearly two billion Switzerland|Swiss cigarettes were smuggled into Germany and Italy. As part of the Marshall Plan, the United States sent free tobacco to Germany; the amount of tobacco shipped into Germany in 1948 was 24,000 tons and was as high as 69,000&nbsp; tons in 1949. The Federal government of the United States spent $70&nbsp; million on this scheme, to the delight of cigarette manufacturing companies in the United States, who profited hugely. Per capita yearly cigarette consumption post-war Germany steadily rose from 460 in 1950 to 1,523 in 1963. The present-day anti-tobacco campaign in Germany has been unable to exceed the seriousness of the Nazi-era climax in the years 1939–41 and German tobacco health research at the end of the 20th century is described by Robert N. Proctor as "muted".
