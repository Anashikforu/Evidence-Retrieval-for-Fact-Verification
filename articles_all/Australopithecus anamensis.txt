Six years later the London-born Kenyan paleoanthropologist Meave Leakey and archaeologist Alan Walker excavated the Allia Bay site and uncovered several additional fragments of the hominid, including one complete lower jaw bone which closely resembles that of a common chimpanzee (''Pan troglodytes'') but whose teeth are much more similar to those of a human. In 1995, Meave Leakey and her associates, taking note of differences between ''Australopithecus afarensis'' and the new finds, assigned them to a new species, ''A. anamensis'', deriving its name from the Turkana word anam, meaning "lake".
